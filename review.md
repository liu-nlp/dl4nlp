# Review

We assume that you have a background in mathematics corresponding to the contents of the WASP course “Mathematics and Machine Learning”. The exercises and assignments require solid programming experience in a high-level language. You should already have some background in machine learning (e.g. via successful completion of the course AI and Machine Learning), and ideally experience in using deep learning frameworks (the programming assignments will use PyTorch). No previous knowledge of NLP is required.

## Introduction to PyTorch

The purpose of this preparatory material is to introduce you to the basics of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), the deep learning framework that we will be using for the exercises and assignments. Many good introductions to PyTorch are available online, including the [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) on the official PyTorch website. The notebook that we provide here is designed to put focus on those basics that you will encounter in the exercises.
