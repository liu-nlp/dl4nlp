# Review

This page collects review material for the course.

## Machine learning

We assume that you have a background in mathematics corresponding to the contents of the WASP course “Mathematics and Machine Learning”. If you need to brush up this up a bit, the following lecture series provides a compact introduction to machine learning and deep feedforward networks.

## Linguistics

We do not expect you to have any background in linguistics, but will often use linguistic terminology. (No natural language processing without language!) The following video provides a compact, 30-minute introduction to some of the essentials of linguistics that you may encounter in the course.

## Basic text processing

The exercises and assignments in this course require solid programming experience. In particular, you will benefit from previous experience with text processing in Python. If you need to get up to speed on this, we have a notebook that introduces some basic concepts and techniques for processing text data.

## PyTorch

As our deep learning framework, we will use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Many good introductions to PyTorch are available online. The notebook we provide here is focused on those concepts and techniques that you will encounter in the exercises and assignments.

## Using Colab

Most of the assignments and exercises will require you to use a GPU-based machine. If you do not have easy access to such a machine at your institution, using Google's free Colab service may be an alternative. We have written [some instructions](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/dat450/reading/using_colab.html) describing the basics of how to work with Colab.
