when i was 11 , i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to bbc news on his small , gray radio .
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
" the taliban are gone ! " my father shouted .
i did n't know what it meant , but i could see that my father was very , very happy .
" you can go to a real school now , " he said .
a morning that i will never forget .
a real school .
you see , i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because taliban were suspicious .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
and my father -- that 's him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
so do you still not want to continue ? "
today i am 22 .
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
instead , i stand here a proud graduate of middlebury college .
my family believes in me .
i dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that 's why i am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
it 's not to say that our mothers are n't key in our success .
under the taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in afghanistan .
afghanistan looks so different from here in america .
i find that americans see the fragility in changes .
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the u.s. troops ' withdrawal .
like me , they are dreaming big .
thank you .
i worked for an italian ngo , and every single project that we set up in africa failed .
and i was distraught .
i thought , age 21 , that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , " thank god we 're here . "
" just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation . "
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in zambia , to this size .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the zambians , " look how easy agriculture is . "
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything .
and we said to the zambians , " my god , the hippos ! "
and the zambians said , " yes , that 's why we have no agriculture here . "
" why did n't you tell us ? " " you never asked . "
because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
you should see the rubbish — -- you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people .
you want to read the book , read " dead aid , " by dambisa moyo , zambian woman economist .
the book was published in 2009 .
we western donor countries have given the african continent two trillion american dollars in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
just go and read her book .
read it from an african woman , the damage that we have done .
the two words come from the latin root " pater , " which means " father . "
but they mean two different things .
paternalistic , i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . " i love you so much . "
patronizing , i treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
that 's why the white people in africa are called " bwana , " boss .
this should be the first principle of aid .
the first principle of aid is respect .
so what you do -- you shut up .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
we do n't work from offices .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
we have zero infrastructure .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
if that person does n't want to do it , what are you going to do ?
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
let me tell you a secret .
there is a problem with community meetings .
so planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people in your community you do n't even know , because they do n't come to your public meetings .
you have to create a new profession .
i started this as a tryout in esperance , in western australia .
how can you do — ? " and i said , " i do something very , very , very difficult .
i shut up , and listen to them . "
so — — so the government says , " do it again . "
we 've done it in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
peter drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
local , passionate people . that 's who you have applauded .
so what i 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
government ? forget about it !
it will be entrepreneurs , and they 're doing it now .
there 's a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in 1860 .
they were already drowning in manure .
so 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
dearborn , michigan . henry ford .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
otherwise they do n't come and talk to you .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
guess what ?
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
it does n't exist .
this person has never been born .
never the word " i , " and the word " we " 32 times .
he was n't alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? "
" oh , no , i can not do this . " " would you like me to find you somebody ? "
we activate communities .
thank you .
five years ago , i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland .
penn state asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
and i was scared .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
but these great conversations ca n't occur if our scientists and engineers do n't invite us in to see their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
and when you 're describing your science , beware of jargon .
jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
instead , as einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points ?
what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
and so , scientists and engineers , when you 've solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
thank you .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria .
with a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to soundcloud and become famous .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
i 'm a child of 1984 , and i live in the city of berlin .
let 's go back to that time , to this city .
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow .
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and i will talk about this .
these are 35,830 lines of information .
raw data .
and why are these informations there ?
because in the summer of 2006 , the e.u. commission tabled a directive .
this directive [ is ] called data retention directive .
who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
who sends whom a text message ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
all this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your internet service provider .
and all over europe , people stood up and said , " we do n't want this . "
they said , we do n't want this data retention .
they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : " we do n't want this . "
and some even said , this would be stasi 2.0 .
stasi was the secret police in east germany .
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
can they really store all this information about us ?
every time i use my mobile phone ?
but then i said , i want to have this information , because this is my life you are protocoling .
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
but deutsche telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for .
because in the mean time , the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e.u. directive into german law was unconstitutional .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c.d. inside .
and on the c.d. , this was on .
thirty - five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
at first i saw it , and i said , okay , it 's a huge file . okay .
but then after a while i realized , this is my life .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i do with it ?
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
but then i said , i want to go out with this information .
i want to make them public .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
so together with zeit online and open data city , i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
you can see every step i take .
and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne , and how often i call in between .
all this is possible with this information .
that 's a little bit scary .
but it is not only about me .
it 's about all of us .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
you can see all of this .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
but self - determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
but you have to fight for your self - determination today .
you have to fight for it every day .
and if you do n't believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
thank you .
i live in south central .
this is south central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
this is south los angeles .
liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
funny thing is , the drive - thrus are killing more people than the drive - bys .
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
and i figured , this has to stop .
so i figured that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
plus i got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that was n't impregnated with pesticides .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
thing is , it 's owned by the city .
but you have to maintain it .
and this is how i decided to maintain it .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
and i 'm like , " come on , really ?
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? "
and i was like , " cool . bring it . "
because this time it was n't coming up .
we had a victory on our hands .
my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing .
i mean , come on , why would n't they ?
l.a. leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
that 's 20 central parks .
that 's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
when one dollar 's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars ' worth of produce .
it 's my gospel , when i 'm telling people , grow your own food .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
see , i have a legacy in south central .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
see , i 'm an artist .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , i beautiful lawns , parkways .
you 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
you just could n't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
so what happened ?
i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the soil .
you 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
plus you get strawberries .
this is on the street for a reason .
and i 'm like , " hell no , i ai n't afraid they 're gon na steal it .
that 's why it 's on the street .
that 's the whole idea .
i want them to take it , but at the same time , i want them to take back their health . "
there 's another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
we 've had , like , 50 people come to our dig - ins and participate , and it 's all volunteers .
if kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next george washington carver .
but if we do n't change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
now do n't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
so what i want to do here , we got ta make this sexy .
so i want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .
we got ta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
if you ai n't a gardener , you ai n't gangsta .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
one of my favorite words in the whole of the oxford english dictionary is " snollygoster . "
just because it sounds so good .
and what snollygoster means is " a dishonest politician . "
now i have no idea what " talknophical " is .
something to do with words , i assume .
and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of brass crosby , who took on parliament .
and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase " as bold as brass . "
most people think that 's down to the metal .
it 's not . it 's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
and they had to face the question of what to call george washington , their leader .
they did n't know .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
and this was debated in congress for ages and ages .
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
not that catchy .
some people just wanted to call him king .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and they were n't even being monarchical there , they had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term .
and , you know , it could have worked .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
i read a diary of this poor senator , who just keeps coming back , " still on this subject . "
and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house of representatives were against the senate .
the house of representatives did n't want washington to get drunk on power .
they did n't want to call him king in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
so they wanted to give him the humblest , meagerest , most pathetic title that they could think of .
and that title was " president . "
it was like the foreman of the jury .
and it did n't have much more grandeur than the term " foreman " or " overseer . "
there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
and that 's why the senate objected to it .
they said , that 's ridiculous , you ca n't call him president .
this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries .
and who 's going to take him seriously if he 's got a silly little title like president of the united states of america ?
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the senate did not cave in .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
barack obama , president obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the senate to spring into action .
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
and so the senate won in the end .
they got their title of respectability .
and also , the senate 's other worry , the appearance of singularity -- well , it was a singularity back then .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
a hundred and forty - seven .
all because they want to sound like the guy who 's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
and that 's the important lesson i think you can take away , and the one i want to leave you with .
thank you very much .
and this was my first time in afghanistan .
but this is the geography of self .
and try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes .
i want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in afghanistan has become conflict chic .
but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
but i do them because i have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
that is my burden . what 's yours ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while i 've been a model .
actually , for 10 years .
and i feel like there 's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because i should not have worn this dress .
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
not everybody gets to do that .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i was n't going to wear them .
all right .
so why did i do that ?
that was awkward .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
and i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and i always just say , " oh , i was scouted , " but that means nothing .
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it 's a legacy that i 've been cashing out on .
and first , i commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
the next question people always ask me is , " can i be a model when i grow up ? "
and the first answer is , " i do n't know , they do n't put me in charge of that . "
but the second answer , and what i really want to say to these little girls is , " why ?
you know ? you can be anything .
it 's out of your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path .
it will look something like this .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
that was , i do n't know what happened there .
the next question people always ask me is , " do they retouch all the photos ? "
and yeah , they pretty much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what 's happening .
i know we 're getting personal , but i was a young girl .
this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
my friend got to come with me .
here 's me at a slumber party a few days before i shot french vogue .
here 's me on the soccer team and in v magazine .
and here 's me today .
and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , " do you get free stuff ? "
but " how many times will i get stopped ? when will i get stopped ? "
so the last question people ask me is , " what is it like to be a model ? "
and when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
and if you ever are wondering , " if i have thinner thighs and shinier hair , will i be happier ? "
thank you .
but do n't you ever turn into a gaddafi - like revolutionary . "
and there it was , a great revolution .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
however , gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
for four decades gaddafi 's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society .
almost 200 organizations were established in benghazi during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi -- almost 300 in tripoli .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
women won 17.5 percent of the national congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs .
on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [ aftermath ] of the revolution .
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
we did not prioritize right .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in libya .
did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
no , it did n't .
what is it , then ?
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
these are the ideals that a war - torn libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
for peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
that 's the real zipper .
and we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
according to a quranic verse " salam " -- peace -- " is the word of the all - merciful god , raheem . "
thus we are told that " my mercy encompasses all things . "
thus we are told that " my mercy takes precedence over my anger . "
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
thank you .
and i was very proud .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and myself , i had never experienced hunger .
but one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . "
i was so shocked .
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering .
soon after , when i was walking past a train station , i saw something terrible that i ca n't erase from my memory .
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother 's face .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid-1990s .
i always wondered why they had lights but we did n't .
this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night compared to neighbors .
this is the amrok river , which serves as a part of the border between north korea and china .
as you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing north koreans to secretly cross .
but many die .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time .
i could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
in china , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
someone had accused me of being north korean , so they tested my chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
i was so scared , i thought my heart was going to explode .
if anything seemed unnatural , i could be imprisoned and repatriated .
i thought my life was over , but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , " this was a false report .
she 's not north korean . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some north koreans in china seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the chinese police and repatriated .
these girls were so lucky .
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
even though i was really fortunate to get out , many other north koreans have not been so lucky .
it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected .
english was so important in south korea , so i had to start learning my third language .
also , i realized there was a wide gap between north and south .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
i even went through an identity crisis .
am i south korean or north korean ?
where am i from ? who am i ?
suddenly , there was no country i could proudly call my own .
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy , i made a plan .
i started studying for the university entrance exam .
just as i was starting to get used to my new life , i received a shocking phone call .
they had to get out quickly , so i started planning how to help them escape .
north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer .
he took everyone 's i.d. cards , and he started asking them questions .
since my family could n't understand chinese , i thought my family was going to be arrested .
he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
i lost all hope .
at that moment , i heard one man 's voice ask me , " what 's wrong ? "
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
i thanked him with all my heart , and i asked him , " why are you helping me ? "
" i 'm not helping you , " he said .
" i 'm helping the north korean people . "
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , english language training , job training , and more .
i 'm confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world , including the ted stage .
thank you .
today i have just one request .
please do n't tell me i 'm normal .
now i 'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
he 's speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators can not .
remi knows what love is .
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
he 's not greedy . he does n't see skin color .
he does n't care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
samuel is 16 . he 's tall . he 's very handsome .
he has the most impeccable memory .
he has a selective one , though .
do n't they sound incredible ?
but most people do n't agree .
and in fact , because their minds do n't fit into society 's version of normal , they 're often bypassed and misunderstood .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why remi is so different from sam .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
he screamed a lot .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
extraordinary .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
you can be extraordinary .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
please -- do n't tell me i 'm normal .
thank you .
how does light look in slow motion ?
now , the whole event
but , coca - cola did not sponsor this research .
some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
as you can see , there 's a bubble of air , and it 's bouncing around inside .
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
it 'll be a very boring movie — — of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
and what about some still - life photography ?
you can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
so how did my team at mit create this camera ?
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
so , superman can fly .
some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
and it 's not science fiction . we have actually built it .
on the left , you see our femto - camera .
there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we 're going to bounce light off the door .
so after our paper was published in nature communications , it was highlighted by nature.com , and they created this animation .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our femto - camera , it has some unique abilities .
it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
can we see it in full 3d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
but there 's also something funny going on here .
when you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
what 's going on here ?
it 's about time . thank you .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
and these projects came from questions i had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time ?
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
now , i live in new orleans , and i am in love with new orleans .
i feel like every time someone sneezes , new orleans has a parade .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved very much .
her name was joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
and i 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
" before i die , i want to be tried for piracy . "
" before i die , i want to straddle the international date line . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions . "
" before i die , i want to plant a tree . "
" before i die , i want to live off the grid . "
" before i die , i want to hold her one more time . "
" before i die , i want to be someone 's cavalry . "
" before i die , i want to be completely myself . "
it 's about knowing you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
thinking about death clarifies your life .
thank you .
thank you .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so i am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what i do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
no expensive staff time required .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while , and that 's one of the example symptoms of it .
the neurologist 's test is non - invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
you do n't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
and they 're both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice - based tests are non - expert .
that means they can be self - administered .
they 're high - speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
they 're ultra - low cost , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes ultra - low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we can do high - frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
thank you .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
so you 're 86 percent accurate right now ?
it 's much better than that .
ninety - nine . well , that 's an improvement .
absolutely .
thanks so much . max little , everybody .
thanks , tom .
this is where i live . i live in kenya , at the south parts of the nairobi national park .
those are my dad 's cows at the back , and behind the cows , that 's the nairobi national park .
nairobi national park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our livestock .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
the morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they 're also upset about this problem .
so they kill the lions .
it 's one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
but i came to realize that that did n't really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
so i did n't give up . i continued .
and a second idea i got was to use a scarecrow .
i was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that i was standing near the cowshed .
but lions are very clever .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so i had an idea .
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so i set up everything .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the cowshed , but i was sleeping in my bed .
thanks .
so i set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if i could put the lights for her .
and i said , " yes . "
so i put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
since now , i 've set up seven homes around my community , and they 're really working .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
and here i am today .
i got a chance to come by plane for my first time for ted .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when i grow up .
ashê olên . it means in my language , thank you very much .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this scholarship . yep .
you 're working on other electrical inventions .
what 's the next one on your list ?
my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
in the trenches . richard turere , you are something else .
we 're going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much . thank you .
there were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
we happened to be back in new york exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
well you can see where this is going .
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
no one 's ever refused , and luckily no one 's ever run off with our camera .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
it 's really become sacred to us .
so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five - year - old standing in that exact spot .
and now what she 's looking at in new york are colleges , because she 's determined to go to school in new york .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
so i want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
i do n't know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , i 'm not in many of the family photos .
i 'm always the one taking the picture .
thank you .
