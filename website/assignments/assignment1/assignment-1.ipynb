    "The error surfaces explored when training neural networks can be very complex. Because of this, it is important to choose ‚Äúgood‚Äù initial values for the parameters. In PyTorch, the weights of the embedding layer are initialised by sampling from the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. Test how changing the initialisation affects the perplexity of your language models. Find research articles that propose different initialisation strategies.\n",
