In this assignment you will implement and train two or three neural language models: the fixed-window model, the recurrent neural network model from Unit&nbsp;1-2, and optionally a model based on the Transformer architecture from Unit&nbsp;1-3. You will evaluate these models by computing their perplexity on a benchmark dataset.
