    "In this assignment, you will implement a simplified version of the dependency parser presented by [Glavaš and Vulić (2021)](http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.eacl-main.270). This parser consists of a transformer encoder followed by a bi-affine layer that computes arc scores for all pairs of words. These scores are then used as logits in a classifier that predicts the position of the head of each word. In contrast to the parser described in the paper, yours will only support unlabelled parsing, that is, you will not implement what the authors call a *relation classifier*. As the encoder, you will use the [uncased DistilBERT base model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert) from the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index) library, even though every other BERT-based encoder should work equally well."
