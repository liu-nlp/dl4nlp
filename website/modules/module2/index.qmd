## Unit 2-1: Modern large language models

This unit reviews some of the central topics related to modern language models (LLMs), notably from the GPT family. We examine their emergent capabilities like zero-shot learning and in-context learning and explore methods for aligning LLMs with human instructions and preferences. Finally, the lectures address the crucial aspect of evaluating general-purpose language models, offering insights into their effectiveness and applicability across various tasks and domains.

## Unit 2-2: Working with open large language models

The lectures in this unit present various techniques that collectively empower users to maximize the utility and efficiency of open large language models in various applications and scenarios. They explore efficient fine-tuning methods and quantization techniques to optimize model performance during training and deployment. The final lecture discusses retrieval augmentation, a strategy to enrich LLMs' responses by incorporating additional information from retrieval systems.
