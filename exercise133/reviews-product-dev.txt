look , the fact is feminism is about choice no more , no less . i have the highest respect for stay at home moms- -it is the hardest darn job on earth . but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie . feminism gave us a choice . it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls . personally , i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species . i work with troubled teens , my skills do not go to waste , i spoil my nieces and nephews- -i am fulfilled and happy . my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys , she is fulfilled and happy , feminism gave us those choices , ladies . we were not " sold " anything , we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us . if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world 's most important job , i think that is your issue and not now's . stop blaming feminism for your insecurities , if you are feminist- -stop blaming your mother for your insecurities- -you have choices because of feminism not despite it !	0
i 've only just begun using this software , but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow . i would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials . i find the tutorial confusing . so far i have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the help section , but it just is n't as straight forward as i would have liked . i purchased this b / c it was rated so high by pc magazine . i 'm sure in time i 'll learn the software better , but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware i have taught myself to use .	5
the charger really did what it was supposed to do . i have an li-10b , so i was still some what worried that it was n't going to do the job , but it did . i also liked that it was small so you can travel with it anywhere .	1
this is a bad movie not only because it does n't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content . it 's like this film attempts to create turtles psychaitry 101. each turtle attempts to work on and / or completely vanquish their weaknesses . leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja , mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter , raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children , and i believe that donny falls in love . it 's been awhile since i 've seen this film so i may have that last thing wrong . more than ten years have passed since i saw this stinker and although i do n't remember every minute detail the problems that i had with it are enormous . first , the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi . the television series and films have n't really gleamed upon that aspect , instead relying on action , humor , and pseudo wisdom from splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product . in my opinion the separate storylines of the turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot . in particular , leo 's and raphael 's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in . the pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments . they just feel heavy handed . that 's not to say mikey 's plotline is n't just as bad , but he 's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute , but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all . secondly , the action is just not there as it was before . sure , it 's still pretty bloodless , but the scenes are few and far between and boring . the turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it 's previous effects of catharsis . it felt like i was watching the history channel special about the history of the turtles war in japan and they lost . also , the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a warner brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles . having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too . i 'm just the kind of guy who likes ( in these kinds of movies ) the bad guys to get a death that you do n't have to see , or feel the impact of because you ca n't imagine when their end comes , like falling down a bottomless pit . to me , bombs are out of the question in terms of death . thirdly , the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny . an example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following , or running from bad guys and they 're going up stairs , lots of stairs and mikey goes , " this is good for my calfs , " i was thinking , " what , is my mom supposed to laugh at that ? " as for the japanese men who take to american living all too well , none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now , it 's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk , painfully unfunny and pointless . equally as pointless was the use of casey jones . his character in the first movie almost steals the show at times , but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the japanese men . in a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles , forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines . in this story the writers would have casey jones completely emasculated , possibly for laughs , possibly for moral . the former is definitely not the case , the latter is underdeveloped . it 's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight , that 's what we 're thinking for a majority of the film . in retrospect , the japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless . so he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series . i admit , it 's a good idea but way too heavy handed . the meaning is always better in small doses . finally , the song used in the film toward the end with the japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting . it was used to great effect in the tv spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting , funny , action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film . oh well , at least found out the name of that song	2
this is not one of the best hair dryers i 've had . at best , it 's average . the nozzle is too long , and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal . i like attachments that can rotate so that i can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair . the ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair . after using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths ( about 3x a week ) , the switch for heat settings is now loose . the dryer only blows cool air even though i slide the switch for higher temperatures . my rating has gone from average to below average	3
not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it wasn't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !	1
while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid-summer weather . we ended up renting " analyze that " and boy , what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's " analyze this . " the potential was there , it 's not as if writers ( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers ) peter tolan , peter steinfeld , and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with ; robert deniro , billy crystal , lisa kudrow , and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy . however , this being hollywood and all , another sequel was botched . it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation . despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some " fish out of water " situations , the movie seemed to go downhill soon after . the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over-the-top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as " crossroads . " now either they ran out of jokes , they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story , or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already ( " the sopranos " , " the whole 9 yards " , " mickey blue eyes " , etc. etc. ) , that there was simply nothing left to write about	2
i used this program on a 5-state road trip of the midwest , and while overall it was " adequate , " it had some key shortcomings . the bad stuff : first , this is not an especially user-friendly program ; there is a steep learning curve to operate it with ease and predictability . spend a lot of time playing with this before using it as a primary navigator ! a lot of the commands are not intuitive , and you need to go through a lot of menus to figure things out . this can be a problem when you are on the road looking to get somewhere . it does n't have a lot of clickable buttons on the main screen . for example , to get the program to talk to you , you must be on a certain tab at the bottom of the screen . if you are on any other of the many tabs , the program does n't talk to you or show you the turns . it took me hours to figure this out ! the help function was useless . second , the tracking can be very slow , and as a result you can easily overshoot your turns- -especially when there are no physical street signs in many areas of the country- -which happened to me numerous times . many times the screen showed me i had a lot farther to go before the scheduled turn , and this caused me to overshoot it when there was no sign . third , the " rerouting " function is awful and perhaps the biggest problem with this program : if you stray from the route- -even to pull off and get gas- -the program flips out and keeps trying to route you back to the original route even if that route is not the easiest or most direct . i have not found a way for it to manually or automatically calculate a new and different route . i also have found no way to modify a route once you begin the route ( see below ) . several times in several different cities , the re-routing function was totally wrong- -spitting out names of streets that were n't even on the screen at close zoom level . this is a really annoying glitch , and it happened without fail every time i strayed from the route . once off route , there is no way to hush the program from yelling at you that you 're off route , and there is also no way to easily have the program recalculate a change in the route . when there is construction that you did n't anticipate , for example , this program sucks at being able to change the route once you 've started on it . very annoying . there is no construction updater plug-in , which would be helpful for long term construction projects that go on forever . fourth , the program does not audibly warn you if you are going the wrong way on a one way street . this actually happened to me , as there were no " one way " signs on a particular street in springfield , il . though there were green arrows on the screen to indicate one-way , but the voice commands did n't warn me that i actually was going the wrong way , so had i not been looking at the screen , i would n't have known . you ca n't always look at the screen when driving . and in iowa on i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over to the southbound lanes . i was heading north in the southbound lanes ( as i was supposed to ) but there was no visual or audible indication that i was going the wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , the search function is wholly lacking and is not easy to use . i needed to find a police station while in missouri- -no such luck . i also needed to find the state fairgrounds in missouri ( which i later came across on the screen ) but it did not show up when i intentionally searched for it . search limitations are the second biggest problem with this program . sixth , several times the screen showed me " off route " in a totally blacked-out area with no roads around me when i was in fact on a u.s. highway or interstate . something was n't communicating correctly . other times the screen showed me more than 1000 feet off the highway even though i was certainly on the highway . in illinois , the screen showed i was pretty much driving through corn fields even though i was on a u.s. route . this problem is pronounced on multi-lane highways . if you 're not in the center lane , often the program indicates you 're off route . very annoying . seventh , the zoom level does not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically between high zoom and far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most of the time to see all the minor roads and landmark indicators , but the program kept zooming out and in every few minutes . eighth , the help function is a joke . it is totally lacking in substantive information . the program should come with a separate dvd movie showing how to use it . ninth , the program does not recognize a lot of road name synonyms . for example , some u.s. routes also have county / state / local designation numbers and / or an alphabetic name , but the map often only listed one or two of the many " also known as " names / numbers . this can be quite problematic when the signs on the roads do n't match up with the turn commands ( e.g. " turn left on u.s. route 40 , " when the only street signs showed an alphabetic name and no numbers . this was also quite annoying . tenth , the antenna that comes with the program sucks . without fail , i would get a red " no signal " indicator in every city i was in where there were high-rise buildings . this happened in kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , and springfield . if you are in a city , you risk having no gps tracking ability . and yes , my antenna was mounted as recommended . at one point i held it up through my open sun roof with no success . eleventh , the main-screen buttons are way too small for use while driving if the laptop is on your passenger 's seat . you pretty much have to pull over or risk crashing to see what you 're clicking on . yes , i 'm aware that the disclaimer for the program states you should have a separate navigator to operate the program while driving . i 'm also aware that almost no one who uses this program actually has a navigator / operator . twelfth , trip planning is lacking . when you input a starting and ending point , the program gives you one route . there is no way to easily plan alternate routes or to preview them . true , you can do things like program it not to take you on toll roads , but this function is not easy to use . several times the program kept me off the interstates when i wanted to be on them , and sometimes it kept my on the interstates when i wanted to be on u.s. or smaller county roads ( for sightseeing purposes ) . i would have to go off route and listen to the program whine about being off route . thirteenth , i emailed a list of my concerns / constructive criticisms / recommendations to the folks at delorme . never heard back from them , which does concern me as a quality issue . ok , so there were some redeeming qualities : first , *in general* the gps tracker was on-target . for about 95% of my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i was and the program operated just fine . just realize that this program ( as well as gps in general ) has a lot of limitations , especially when there is bad weather or you are in a woodsy area or place with a lot of obstructions . third , you can easily add points of interest and comments yourself . i used this function a lot to mark places where i want to return to take photos in daylight . fourth , there is a selectable function to show high contrast colors ( black background with bright road colors ) . this is quite helpful . in summation , for the money this program is a good deal , but do not rely on it ( or any gps program ) as your *sole* source of road information / navigation . if i had n't had my rand mcnally paper road atlas and back-up state and city maps i borrowed from the library , i would have been in big trouble several times . there are a lot of ways this program can and should be improved , but in the meantime i 'd still recommend it despite the problems . knowing the limitations that i 've listen can save you time and frustration . there is no better alternative imho for the price . it 's possible that some of my complaints do have fixes , but you would n't know it from the crappy help function .	5
i ca n't give this book more than two stars , and that 's being generous . mr. hall does present some interesting ideas , but unfortunately , his editors have done him a huge disservice . here are the first three sentences of stage i , on page 23 ; essentially what we have now- -nanoscale science and technology- -including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes , and a very limited ability to manipulate , that is , by pushing things around with the same scanning probes . a scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick . because you have a computer behind it , you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture . i made it through the first fifty pages , and it did n't get any better . i do n't know if mr. hall had a final read before publication , or not , but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited .	0
i have known canon to be a very high quality company . however , i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera . a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800. i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400. for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine . however , if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime , this camera is worse than a disposable camera . first , there is no red-eye reduction . it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod . third , night picture ? ....forget about it . i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed . so , i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i 'll be back in the market for a fujifilm . after all the reviews i 've read , i 'm waiting for the other shoe to drop ( e18 , lcd , etc. ) . not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about	1
rosetta stone spanish is the third major spanish course that i am buying . i have comtpleted all of the spanish lessons in the pimsleur series , and have also completed learning spanish like crazy level one and two . i am one of those rare latinas that did not learn spanish from my parents . my mexican parents felt that it would be easier to " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going to my grandparents ' home for holidays and being the only one there that did not speak spanish , and after having latino strangers speak to me in spanish and then look at me in astonishment when i struggled just to say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt that it was time for me to learn how to speak my language . the first course that i used was pimsleur spanish . compared to rosetta stone i must say that i learned much more vocabulary with the rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially for the complete beginner . because of its easy teaching method , in my opinion pimsleur is even better than lslc for someone that has no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes at a very slow pace . but if you have already learned some spanish on your own or in high school or college , then you can probably skip pismleur and go straight to lslc . or if you are the type of person that believes learning a foreign language should be more like a hurdle than a marathon you 'll probably want to go with learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers a lot more spanish words and grammar than pimsleur and moves at a quicker pace . so where does rosetta stone fit in ? i would say use rosetta stone after you have completed the above courses . it is difficult to really learn how to speak spanish with this software alone because you are only looking at pictures and repeating the phrases that you hear . you never really learn how to think in spanish and create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how to speak some spanish from another course and you are on an intermediate level then you can add plenty more spanish words to your vocabulary by using the rosetta stone software . one negative about this course is that the method is tedious because the software 's interface is " antiquated " with photos from the 1980s . and the sound quality is not as clear as pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through the drudgery , you will be surprised with how many spanish words you learned with this software . but i think pimsleur did a better job of teaching me concepts than this software is doing . and by teaching me concepts , i have really retained the material and by understanding concepts , i am able to take my own thoughts and form sentences . something that i would not have been able to do if i had used this course alone . another negative about this course , is that unlike the other two courses that i mentioned , you have to use rosetta stone while sitting in a computer . that is difficult for me because i am very busy with classes , work and my personal life . i can use pimsleur or lslc on my mp3 player and not have to worry about sitting at a computer . besides the limited vocabulary and the slow teaching method , the only downside of pimsleur is that it does not teach the same spanish words that are most commonly used by mexicans and other latinos in regular conversation . pimsleur spanish is very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " and in our overly " macho " culture if a man responds with " encantado " many latinos may get the wrong impression about him . it is not something that i am proud to say about my ( latino ) culture , but it is true . and pimsleur does not warn the male student that if you say " encantado " to some latinos they may get the wrong impression about the speaker . learning spanish like crazy has taught me useful practical spanish that i can use to communicate with my spanish speaking friends and family . when i tell people that i learned to speak spanish as an adult and not at home as a child , many of them do not believe me . i think they find it incredible for two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like a native speaker from using lslc . two , i have learned real conversational spanish from lslc . i have learned words and phrases that spanish speakers actually use when speaking to each other . pimsleur taught me spanish that the author of the course thought that i should speak , not the spanish that latinos really speak . that is one of the positive things that separates lslc course from the others . so in what order would i rate the three in terms of ease of teaching method : 1. pimsleur spanish 2. learning spanish like crazy 3. rosetta stone spanish but in terms of teaching real conversational spanish and teaching a real latin american accent , i rate them as follows : 1. learning spanish like crazy 2. pimsleur spanish 3. rosetta stone spanish	5
this is a most beautiful movie . i can ` t imagine anyone not enjoying it . the two disc package is brilliant and i will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after i have gone	2
let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even " boring " to my friends . so it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me . it is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me . it was n't the violence ( in short bursts . ) it was n't the acting ( the acting was pretty good actually ) . but as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure . i did n't care who was sending the tapes and i did n't care what would happen with the main characters . they were unrelatable on just about any level . this movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3 / 4 's of the way in and you 'll think , " wow i wonder where the story will go next " . and then it doesn't . that was it . very disappointing . i do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's some kinda payoff in the end . i really do n't understand all the acclaim that this movie got . as a " suspense " movie or as an " art " film it fails pretty miserably . the premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly . viewer beware .	2
this product is extremely difficult to learn . i recently purchased two more expensive manuals ro learn the process and also the tutorials the company has are beyond the average users learning .	5
i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos . we promptly sent it back for a refund . i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !	1
listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years . i remembered all their songs i loved back then . it 's a great homecoming	4
this is a great value - probably one of the best shower heads i 've used . yes - there are better ones for $100+ , but this is absolutely amazing	3
when i first heard this album i was a bit shocked . myself and my fellow tmbg fans derided it as a " teen angst album , " moaned and whined that john & john had betrayed us by adding a band , and generally refused to give it a chance . a few years later , listening to my entire collection of tmbg in chonological order ( a sanity-restoration ritual ) , i realized that this album is awesome ! there are only 2 stupid songs , window and dirtbike . hey , for tmbg , that 's not bad - their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis . aside from that , there are more rockin ' , thought-provoking tunes here than you 'll find almost anywhere . this album establishes beyond a doubt that tmbg are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history . i 'm not going to go over each individual song - there are millions of tmbg fans who have and will . i will add my 2 cents about my 4 favorites however : " i should be allowed to think " - tmbg does justice to beat poetry , and beyond ! " why must i be sad ? " - funny and pissy , great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck . the lyrics are genius , subtly quoting the best of alice cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek . " a self called nowhere " - righteous , angry , and breathtaking . angsty punk bands of the world , take note : you will never be this hardcore . " the end of the tour " - i have written in my last wishes that i want this one played at my funeral . one of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written . if your idea of tmbg is songs like " istanbul " and " particle man , " get over it ! and give this album a chance !	4
i purchased the 75-300mm for a trip to a nascar nextel cup championship in homestead , fl . i was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning . the lens is not very sharp , feels very cheap , and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light . i packed up and returned the lens about an hour after i got off the plane . i am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture . i suggest you do the same .	1
this album sparked the so-called " neo-soul " movement years before it was adopted by other artists . back in early 1986 everything was about synthesizer overkill and prince broke the music back down to its roots . this concept was later used by tone tony toni , brand new heavies , and d'angelo .	4
do n't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package . it is the full version ready to be installed . do n't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start . so far , i have not noticed a dime 's worth of difference from the pro version . it is working great . however , the vista coupon shipped with my package expired on march 15 , 2007. additionally , the coupon only applied to new systems purchased between october 26 , 2006 and march 15 , 2007 , so do n't let the vista thing induce you	5
incredible does describe this movie - incredibly bad ! this movie does n't know what it wants to be . at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of " mississippi burning " or the anger and impunity of " ghosts of mississippi " , or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre . at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors , matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock . as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre 's list of movies for lack of originality , and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence . if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book , then i have no interest in reading the book . i 'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper . but the direction does n't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own . bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role , proving she 's only worthy of b-grade " miss congeniality " type crud . mcconaughey over acts so much ( as can be said for keifer sutherland and others ) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan , kevin spacey and donald sutherland . samuel l . jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever , but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in . even the extras in this movie are horrible . enough ca n't be said about the terrible direction in this movie , equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault , making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison . this is not " a powerful film . " it 's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast , a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience , and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions , culminating in an over the top , pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that would n't hold water in any real court of justice . maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt , or because they have n't seen quality comparisons and classics like " mississippis burning , " that has both a great script and fabulous acting . i do n't know . all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies	2
i know that i am at an fpo address so that makes it more difficult to send and receive parcels but , to have never gotten the parcel is unsatisfactory . i never got the item that you wish me to make a review on . send it to me and i will gladly use it and then review it	3
even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am , i really do n't care much for this album . i say thank goodness for " creep " because we may have never heard from them again ( or at least not in the same way ) if that song had not become as popular as it did	4
i love this program ! ! ! it is so great to see the dimensions , wall colors , decorating ideas at my fingertips	5
the first time you play this cd you 're just gonna hate it . promise ring 's third album is the opposite of this . very emergency is super catchy and tight but you get sick of it quick , there 's just not much there . that understood , this album will rock you for years . it grows on you . at first listen it sounds like really bad emo demos . like the faceless band you saw open for fugazi the last time they hobbled into town . no hooks , no choruses , lots of really bad singing and sloppy guitar [with the drums mixed way too loud , an emo thing]. on the 100th listen , if you make it that far , it will sound like an old friend yammerin ' on about the good old days . trust me , it 's a desert island disc in the making , i envy those of you just discovering this cd	4
got my chillow a few months ago and wish i had not waited so long ! it is great ! my own personal " thermostat " having gone haywire years ago , i have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool . this is it ! first , it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he 's so darn warm and i just ca n't take the extra heat . second , i have wished for a firm pillow forever ! ! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm . it can be a bit too cold for a minute or two , but it evens out before long . for those of you who have that problem , you might consider doing what i did . i purchased a " bedsack " quilted & zippered pillow cover . put the pillow + the chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it 's just perfect . might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about . i will agree that the chillow makes my pillow very heavy , but that is my only complaint . and i 'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue . other than that , i wish i had purchased one of these chillows long ago . it is a menopausal woman 's dream come true !	3
it has been a long time since i read the novel upon which this book is based , but i do clearly remember it making sense . this movie does n't even make sense ( to quote a chicken i know ) . marlon brando somnambulizes his way through the film and , instead of coming off as sinister , menacing , and dominating , he makes dr. moreau into a joke . val kilmer 's portrayal is vacuous and silly . is the character supposed to be under the influence ? i guess he wanted it portrayed that way . the script ? is there one ? moreau talks about having almost reached his goal . where ? his one " son " and his " daughter " do have some fine traits , but both are also pretty ineffectual . several reviews have mentioned the special effects . i actually saw very few special effects . the rat-people on the boat were creepy and well-done , and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves , but mostly i saw people in very elaborate , well-done costumes , using well-distorted voices . the central character , played by david thewlis , should have been the focus of the movie , as he is the narrator . he kept getting lost in the shuffle , and i kept waiting for him to see things that i saw , and to ask the questions that i would have asked . i like him as an actor , but this is certainly not a memorably good performance . it is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal-human hybrid horror here , but is the werewolf in " harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban . " the film does create a sense of the nightmare . several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness , most notably ron perlman 's preacher , but then he 's well-practiced , from his " beauty and the beast " television series . that was what ( barely ) earned this film its second star . let 's vote them all off the island , and start over . robert duvall as moreau ? replace kilmer with matt damon ? casey affleck replacing david thewlis	2
i love fairy tales ! i was so excited to see the author of beauty had another retelling . spindles end has me very confused . i am plugging through it and hope when i am done with it a second time i can give it more stars . i would not recommend it for younger readers	0
after springing for the cybershot in august so i could have a compact camera i would actually take places , i 've been very , very pleased . the last camera i had was an older sony dsc that was quite bulky , ran on batteries , and had shutter problems- -but it took great quality pictures and the interface and features were perfect , so i thought i would go for the dsct5 , since it avoids all of those problems . only a tiny battery to charge , no sticky shutter.. . and it 's sexy as hell . the screen is huge and very bright . i hate taking pictures with flash in general , and i find that the flash makes nasty redeye more often than not with this camera . ( and the camera gives you the impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you can easily change this by going into the over / under exposure options and under exposing your photos when you are in dark environments . they come out surprisingly well and blur-free	1
any sam kinison fan needs to own this dvd or video . you get 2 of sam 's hbo specials plus many special stand up features and sam 's home movies . the only reason i did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called : rare stand up ( i love the special features on dvds ) , sam told many jokes that were already on the hbo special . other than that , sam 's comedy is unlike anything you will see today . he will really be thought of as a comedy legend . these dvd 's will crack you up . i would recomend buying the sam kinison cds , live from hell , and have you seen me lately ? the cd 's ( just listen to them in your car or at home ) will give you the complementary material you need ( plus the hbo specials ) to truely love sam kinison . he is one of the best , and you will be satisfied with with any purchase . just buy 1 cd or dvd and you will be hooked	2
this album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste . being a huge alan parsons fan , it pains me to have to say this , but this was almost a total waste of vinyl , energy and money	4
i bought three dvds ( the wood was one of them ) and the dvds were in european codes which means they wo n't play in the united states unless you own a " special " dvd player . i 'm very unhappy with my purchase . my recommendation to you is that you read every single piece of information before you purchase movies that were formatted for another country . this is the catch when you buy movies at cheaper prices	2
had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it , have'nt regretted it one bit . this lens is clear with excellent color , saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing . coupled with an external flash it 's great indoors as well . have been using it as my everyday walk around lens . zoom range is excellent ( rebel xt / xti 1.6 magnification ) . though it 's somewhat on the big side , it wo n't tire you out carrying it around your neck . purchased the hood seperately which , for the money should have came with the lens . anyway , this lens offers excellent value for the money and you wo n't regret the investment	1
as i have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult , as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus . i thought this might be a solution . this eyecup fails on all requards . worst feature , the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect . second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless . last it has the cheep feel of cracker jack plastic , well and the optics to match . now i know where olympus had it manufactured	1
wonderful . i forgot how many great songs they have	2
the canon rs-60e3 is all that canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash , focus , then release the shutter once , a multiple of times , or hold it open for bulb exposure . although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture , it was simple enough to make an " extension " that allows for very remote exposures	1
ok , so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was , well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina 's breasts . the acting was poor , the script was stupid , and the sets were lame . i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time ( ie killer kondom ) but this one took the cake. . i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day . save your money . if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week ;	2
hi have a rebel extreme , and needed to use the high-speed mode.. . but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up . i was taking pictures of dancers , so needed a flash system that could keep up . the speedlite really does this perfectly - i 'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos , and this flash system is there each time . i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo , but if you want a flash that can keep up , this one is great ! i like it so much , i 'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot , to run in slave mode with this one .	1
i enjoy the tc80n3.you may think it 's costly , but the features are out standing.i think it was worth the buy.the only disappointment i have is there is no " on , off " power switch	1
there is now no trace of delight left in this band . all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent . i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe-eyed look saying their name , but this cd and the cd previous ( which did have 1 tune , " apples , " with which one could smile ) does , for the first time , take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes . first , we loose the roses , then the ned 's disband , following that , swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore . now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were .	4
i found this program simple , easy to operate . however , when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio . the narration matched each picture perfectly , when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off . do not count on any tech support . they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all . you have the option of forking over $35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone - but it still does not guarantee it will help . and now , i 'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	5
until i bought several weeks worth of rayovac alkaline d cells , i used duracell alkaline d cells . every week i run a 3-cd changer ( jvc _cx-xc370 ) for 11 hours worth of water aerobic classes , at the same volume level ( volume #10 ) , from tuesday to thursday . the duracells lasted all 11 hours ( and might last even longer ) . in contrast , these rayovac d cells for the last three weeks ( maybe four weeks ) have consistently died during the second half of the next-to-last class ( after hour 9.5 and before hour 10 ) .	3

a good product , to be sure...i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased . this " review " is however a cautionary : while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads , it is only rated for 18 loads . just a heads up ! [note : i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment . thus , this " review "	3
though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii , there are some great ones to pick from . for instance , for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i , try the doughboys by gary mead . for a good look at the events of gallipoli , just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli , which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare . there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne . the list goes on and on , whether it be flanders , the somme , passchendaele , africa , jutland , whatever your area of interest might be . the point i 'm making is , there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i , and even several overviews of the war , but john keegan 's the first world war , is a great source for an overall study of the war . this book covers it all , in brief detail . accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself . every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here . i 've never been a big fan of keegan . his writing , to me , is a struggle at times . this book is no exception . it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times . but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style , he is a virtual historical genius . his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted , and he writes , for the most part , without imparting his own commentary . in fact , without prior knowledge , one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself , british . the big exception to that is keegan 's typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues . in this aspect , he even contradicts himself in several places . he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918 , germany was still very much capable of winning the war . the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front . the new soldiers from the east brought with them , battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph , as they had in the east . he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april , advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days . he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how , though ambitious and courageous , the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war . when he does acknowledge american victory , it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces . that said , if you 're seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months , this book will infuriate you . however , if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole , this is one of the best out there . i should add , the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study . monty rainey [...]	0
i bought this because a few people had put it in their amazon lists . i just did n't like it at all . it is one of those albums where you play it , and you do n't take notice of it until the cd stops playing . it is very old and the music is simplistic . cool cover though	4
cheesy instructor the instructor 's voice covers the music in the background which turns you off going on with the exercize , the music itself is monotonous and the beat is not inline with the moves . the instructor is too fast to follow..to cut it short i do not recommend this for anyone ..totally not professional	2
add another e18 error code complaint to the list ! i purchased the camera about a year ago , and have had the e18 error for about the last 2 months . the camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all , just beep at you and give you an error code e18. i 've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist . nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots . canon wants nothing to do with the fix , and estimates repairs between $150 and $200. save the headaches , and buy another camera from a different manufacturer !	1
i 've been doing this dvd workout for two years , and i still ca n't make it all the way through the " level 2 " workouts . this video is incredibly challenging , but i like that i can do the " level 1 " workouts and have the goal of making it to the next level one day . no other dvd can accomplish what tamilee does in 15 minutes . this really makes me value how efficient she is at giving you exercises that are really challenging and in a short amount of time . i am always sore the next day when i do her workouts . this is a great dvd	2
it was some years ago when i bought a previous cd version of this encyclopedia . although technology has advanced , and wikipedia has come into existence , encyclopedia britannica is more reliable .	5

this book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader . chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist , and his experiences in kenya . a forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology . a forensic anthropologist has a ph.d . and studied anthropology , specializing in the human skeletal system . chapter 3 tells about his laboratory , and the tools used for his work . chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on . chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs . the interstate highway system provides arteries for crimes and serial killers . ( p.63 ) . chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide . many people kill themselves without intending to . it is important to distinguish between murder and suicide ( p.86 ) . page 87 tells why florida has an inordinate number of suicides . chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders . this chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science . page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste ! chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging , they are constantly reshaping themselves . in chapter 9 maples tells of the use of capital punishment ( p.128 ) , and discusses the various methods ( pp.129-131 ) . he seems emotionally involved . chapter 10 informs us about cremation . chapter 11 has maples ' most difficult and most fascinating and perplexing case . the two dead in high springs fl were linked to a shocking double murder in new hampshire ( p.152 ) . page jennings ' parents made a big , fatal mistake in sending their daughter so far away after her failure as a freshman ( p.164 ) . chapter 12 deals with the mia in vietnam , about 2200 compared to the 8170 in korea . hollywood movies created this popular image of captured men ( p.187 ) . a " delusion " ( p.188 ) ? maples describes the us army central identification laboratory that identifies remains recovered from vietnam . page 202 tells what happened at the executive office building . chapter 13 tells of his investigation to recognize the skeleton of pizarro , and correct an old mistake . the exhumation of president zachary taylor and the tests for arsenic poisoning are told in chapter 14. page 224 tells of his importance to those times : he backed free states in the new territories . his replacement changed his policies . chapter 15 may be the most historically important . maples was part of a team that identified the bones of tsar nicholas and his family . maples draws political conclusions from " rotten , neglected teeth " ( p.259 ) . chapter 16 tells of the murder of five college students over two days in gainesville florida . maples identified the murder weapon ( pp.271-273 ) . the book concludes with the complaint that states are not funding forensic anthropologists , who are few and far between , especially in florida ( pp.278-279 ) . florida is " the most crime-ridden state in the union " . that is a political decision for each state government . this recalls the most realistic portion of " quincy , m.e. " : whenever quincy wanted to do more research , his manager often said " there 's no money in the budget " !	0
over the last two years , i have found h&r block 's tax cut software to be simple to use to process an otherwise complex tax return . i would recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable tax preparation source without having to pay the accountant 's fees	5

these are by far the best newborn size diapers especially for small babies , but if you order them through amazon , your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive ! i waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1 , which actually arrived in a few days ! update : i have ordered pampers again through amazon ( different size ) and they shipped right away	3
i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past-shoulder-length hair . it works great ! i gotta admit , it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the " extra large " size towel ( which is n't really all that large .	3
this digital camera is awesome . i have no problem with the batteries . i made sure i put the good batteries in ( no cheap ones ) . i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price . i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it . i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march.... . awesome digital camera..... . you wo n't be sorry on this purchase.. .	1
this is a colleciton of seven or so stories told by a mouse to mice about mice . it is one of those books that is simply fun to read , particularly to the wee ones at bed time . the illustrations are quite good and the nicest thing about the stories are that they are just about as much fun for the adult to read as it is for the kid . very nice illustrations , well done . recommend this one highly .	0
warner herzog 's " grizzly man " won the director 's guild award for best feature documentary , but the people who pass out oscars apparently did n't agree . " grizzly man " was not among this year 's nominees for best documentary . many of herzog 's narrative films , such as " fitzcaraldo , " deal with man 's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature , so " grizzly man " is not a departure by any means . herzog 's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious , even bizarre , goal . timothy treadwell 's fixation is on grizzly bears . " i am one of them , " he is heard to say . he survived in the wild , accompanied by a video camera , and , on at least one occasion , by a girlfriend . , living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting . " animals rule , " he said , fist defiantly pumping in the air . " timothy conquered . " treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life , appearing once on david letterman 's cbs show , but he aspired to more . before letting his love of animals consume him , he tried his luck in hollywood . he got an agent , and auditioned for tv and movie roles . he was , he told his parents , second choice for the bartender role on " cheers " which went to woody harrelson . missing out on that opportunity left him " crushed . " what really drove treadwell ? he reminds me of fey little carson on " queer eye for the straight guy , " and as he openly mentions that it 's easier to be gay than straight , i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation , transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable : grizzly bears . " i like girls , " he volunteers , but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops , men 's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts . he was also an alcoholic . were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue ? those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality . they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive , hippy , new age approach to nature and who died as a result . the bears , to whom he gave names like " mr. chocolate " and " tabitha , " need protection , he said , and he was their self-appointed caretaker . others suggest that , despite his good intentions , he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined . after treadwell was eaten by a bear , the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife . shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken . what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf ? treadwell was an intruder . one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits . but treadwll knew these were animals . trouble is , his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons . the universe , director herzog says , is ruled by hostility , chaos , and murder . treadwell had a different philosophy . " is n't that sad ? " he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing " his pollen thing . " " i love that bee , " he says . partially financed by the discovery channel , " grizzly man " is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans . but it 's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because , he admitted , he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows . he also needed to record his solitary life on video . we see him crying as he pets a wolf , laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed , and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals . what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him . mercifully , the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked . the camera was running , though , and treadwell 's screams , and the screams of his girlfriend , were recorded . out of respect for his family , herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings . instead , we see him listening to the audio , and his reaction ( telling one of treadwell 's friends that she must never listen to it , just as she must never see the coroner 's photos of the aftermath of the attack ) , is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film . " i had no life , " treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts . " now i have a life . " that life is memorialized in herzog 's film . brian w . fairbank	2
if you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of andre norton , then this is an excellent starting point . believable , heroic characters and a well thought-out & quot ; witch world&quot ; combine to make for an enjoyable read . simon tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people . a struggle goes on between good and evil , and it 's not clear who is winning . ( but , we know who wins in the end - & quot ; good&quot ; , of course . ) the style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings . that , and the fascinating settings , imaginative perils faced , and strong likable characters make this a & quot ; must read&quot ; . this is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story . it does not suffer from the typical overinflated , overwordy , overcomplicated , and overcharacterized ( and lifeless ) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today	0
the only misstep so far in a wonderful series . i was so eager for the book , i got a copy of the british edition , before it got to the us . but i was disappointed . somehow this just just does n't get off the ground . could davis be tiring of falco ? it seems to me that she is . maybe it 's time to do something , lindsey ! make some real changes in tbe characters ' situations or kill them off . real dullness in the supporting cast and plot , and the main characters ( besides falso , who always has a life of his own ) pall	0
i kid you not , this suite , program , resource *thug* is the worst garbage on the market . like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to hell i had logged in with other so called " security suites " over the years . works ok for about the first month or so and then...whammmm..crash city . think i 'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself . i 'm no pro yet , but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my pc goes from ( normal to choke ) out of the clear blue . uinstalled it ( 3x ) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem , sure enough , it was . other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it 's true . stay away...stay far..far..away	5

i purchased the wp-dc700 underwater case for my a70 and followed the directions exactly , oiling the gasket and cleaning it after each use . it leaked and ruined my month old camera . customer service was rude , blamed me and then tried to bargain with me to fix it for $190 instead of the $280 that they initially requested . the underwater case has a 7 day waranty and the camera is not covered for water damage . my father had a similar problem with his $1000 nikon digital which just stopped working for no aparent reason , they claimed it was water damage and tried to bargain with him to buy a rebuilt one for $500. so beware of bad customer service . canon 's customer service has all bad unreasolved reviews at the better business burea	1
this thing is a nightmare . first , it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system . next , it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers ( believe me - - read the help files on this , which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music does n't sound good , and trust me , it wo n't , either before or after unlimited tweaking ) . finally , it actually does not export as it says it does . it lost my files , including one song i cannot quite reproduce ( gone forever ) . bottom line : if your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work , then by all means , buy this garbage . i have been using computers since 1985 , and this is , i think , the worst single product i 've ever seen . on the other hand , if you want to actually make music , you might want to try sony 's acid pro 6 , which you can try out for free ( the company thinks you 'll like it , whereas the sadists at cakewalk must know perfectly well that you wo n't , hence no demo ) .	5
this is ann waldron 's best mcleod dulaney mystery yet . the characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page ( and , in some cases , right into your heart ) . the setting- -the princeton theological seminary- -is perfect ( a perfect place for a murder , that is ) , and the plot is downright diabolical . are you in the mood for some humorous , mysterious and sinfully well-written fun ? then do yourself a favor and read this delightful book	0
once again mr. updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women - love , lust , betrayal , self doubt . villages relates owen 's life as only john updike can . the last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book , but i will certainly recommend it to all my friends	0
why on earth am i giving this movie five stars ? its plot is minimal . the script has words and phrases i 've never heard , and i 'm not sure were ever really used in the real world . and to top that off , it 's more than a little unbelievable . however , despite all of the possible downsides , i really enjoyed it . honestly , i 'm normally not into these kinds of films , but it was just good fun . the humor was n't disgusting and gross . the chemistry between the actors made the on screen relationships believable ( even if i do n't ever buy the whole love at first sight scenario ) , and there was n't some great moral constantly being shoved down my throat . all in all , it was just a fun movie to watch , and it 's been a long time since a movie simply put a smile on my face	2

i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage x ( about 15% small in size than this camera ) had reached the end of its useful life , having been around for about 5 years . the minolta had a 3 / 4 " screen on the back . ( this one has a 2.5 " screen - great colors ) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens . i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty . therefore , i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom . tonight i was at a bulls game , in the 300 section ( nose bleed ) , and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich . the 3x optical zoom is incredible , but more so incredible is the digital zoom . i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron , and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly . action shots are great . low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for	1
people , what a killer release this is . i bought it in ' 92 when it was released , not knowing what to expect , as i had never heard a single cut from it . i knew schonn was the axeman on this baby , and that was all i needed to know . i popped this cd in the player , and was instantly floored . what great melodic , poweful tunes filled my ears . i 'm not much of a ballad fan , but even those are great . dean castronova on drums was the perfect choice for this type of release , as he adds the power to schonn 's precision . this is how neal would have played with journey , had the suits let him do so . the gioeli brothers , unknown to me at the time , do a masterful job as well . it 's such a shame that great bands make an album or two , and just fade away , ie . lynch mob , badlands and these guys , to name a few . this release is far superior to their second offering , but that one is pretty tasty as well . i suggest paying the coin for this cd , as it 's worth every penny . hardline 2 will run you about twice as much , but imports often do . get ' em both if ya ' can , but this one is the best of the 2. peace .	4
according to charles kimball , religion is the most powerful and pervasive force on earth . religion inspires humans to transcend their self-interests , while at the same time , more evil has been committed in the name of religion than any other human institution . using a comparative religious approach , kimball uncovers five warning signs that increase the likelihood of a religion becoming unhealthy or evil . kimball argues the word ` religion ' is amorphous and difficult to define . as a result , the author believes a comparative religious methodology is necessary , one that sees the similarities and interconnectedness of all religions . kimball , next , asks if religion is the cause of evil , and he answers both yes and no . a religion that is arrogant , condescending , and requires adherents to " disconnect their brain " is problematic . on the other hand , religion opens up humanity to a universe of purpose and beauty and teaches how to live meaningful and moral lives as individuals and in community . kimball seeks to discover the signs that increase the likelihood of religion becoming evil . the first warning sign that religion is displaying tendencies towards evil is the belief and adherence to absolute truth claims . when conceptualizations of god are held with certainty and rigid doctrine , the propensity towards evil increases dramatically . sacred texts , sources of wisdom and guidance , become abused when selective readings of the text are used to reinforce these absolute truth claims . christianity and islam have missionary mandates , but these become imperialistic when conversion is forced because of absolute truth claims . kimball argues for a " human view of truth " , one that is dynamic and relational , allowing adherents to affirm truth without solidifying truth claims into absolute propositions . another pivotal point when religion becomes evil is blind obedience : when adherents abdicate personal responsibility to religious authorities . when a charismatic leader demands total obedience , has unrestricted power , and has total control , religion is unhealthy . uncritical acceptance of doctrine is also unhealthy , as authentic religion encourages questions and reflection . strict segregation from the larger society , combined with a leader with unlimited power is dangerous . kimball asserts that religious inquiry and freedom of thought are necessary for responsible religious adherence . every religious tradition believes that something is awry on earth , while some believe that an ideal time will arrive in the future . when adherents believe they can speak for god and wish to usher in this time , the likelihood for disaster increases . many muslims embrace the hope for an all islamic society , zealous jewish settlers dream of a time when israel will be returned to its divinely promised status , and the christian religious right believe that america should be politically structured with christian principles in mind . kimball opines those who narrowly define temporal structures of the state and those who believe they are god 's agents to usher in a theocracy are dangerous . religion also becomes a force for evil when the ends justify any means : when one theological component gets elevated , thus becoming an end , and adherents become consumed with achieving or protecting this end . all religions have notions of sacred space , but an unhealthy religion becomes obsessed with protecting this space . reinforcing or protecting group identity against an ` other ' , or protecting group identity from within the group , are also potentially dangerous signs . institutional structures develop in all religious traditions , but corruption occurs when the protection of the institution becomes the end . kimball asserts that a healthy religion preserves the connection between means and ends . the last warning sign occurs when religious leaders believe their struggle is a " holy " war . kimball outlines the history of pacifism to the just war theory and crusader ideals within christianity , and he shows how each of these views were represented in the gulf war of 1990-91. islam is a peaceful religion , which asks adherents to build a just and peaceful social order . the word jihad means " struggling in the way of god , " but in a narrower sense jihad is understood as a struggle in a military sense - with rules similar to the christian just war theory . because of socio-economic disparities , some muslims openly advocate violent means to achieve revolutionary ends , and some leaders declare this revolution as a holy war in order to legitimize their cause . kimball believes both that christian and muslim adherents should not speak of war but of peace and that the call for holy war is not holy . with the knowledge of when religion becomes evil , religions have a clear understanding of healthy praxis . faith , hope , and love should be the guiding spiritual compass for all religious adherents , so that in times of conflict unhealthy religious mechanisms can be averted . against secularism , kimball finds validity in religious traditions because of the time-tested wisdom and ethical standards , and he believes that religions should embrace religious diversity . with religious diversity christians have three options , exclusivism , inclusivism , and pluralism , but kimball believes each position has value if adherents from different faiths work together for the common good of humanity . finally , the middle east represents a microcosm for the world community : if peaceable solutions are not found in the arab-israeli-palestinian conflict , then the future for the world community and world religions are bleak	0
if you like redon for his vibrant color , look for another book . dream symbolism and spirituality that inspired redon 's imagery are the main topics of this book . most of the many examples are black and white drawings . however , the real magic of redon is his use of color in his mature works . this was not adequately represented .	0
i just got my copy of the dvd r-rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing . why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me . since this scene is most appealing in the way the original version first displayed it in 85 , to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely . i was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie . if anyone saw the unrated 1985 vhs version you would know what i mean . lana was the movie . why remove it ? ? ? ? ? i have [not a] clue ! ! ! unsatisfied customer	2
a singularly dull book , the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung , a south victorious with modern weapons , seemed too trivial . the author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing . unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not . the character of robert e . lee in the book is just too , too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts . i finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that i put it down halfway through . i am not sure if it turns out the way i think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other	0
when i was a kid , i religiously read many of the marvel comics . the avengers was one of my favorites . in my dreams i would have loved to have read all of the issues , but the expense would have been ( way ) too much . now , after so many years the opportunity is finally here . i was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore , but i took a chance and bought this dvd anyway . it was worth it - by a mile . i am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as i would have as a kid . it will take a long time to get through them all , but i 'll enjoy every minute . stan lee , thank you for such a simple pleasure . great stuff for kids of all ages	5
i have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more . the language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words . these books can cause you embaesment , since i read where ever i have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it . please we would all like to see more of these	0

there is not one book this woman has been involved in that i did n't like so far . many stories you will find in her book have different personalities , which i find refreshing . she has been involved in many science fiction projects and when i go to pick up a book with her name on it.....i know there will be something , if not everything , i will enjoy in that book . there should be no question when you see a book with her name on it , that you should open that book and read a while	0
he trabajado por 14 anos con coreldraw....desde casi sus inicios...para verlo convertirse en un programa realmente poderoso...sin competencia en su area a mi parecer . en esta nueva version de corel...el x3...les digo que no me ha desilucionado....no hay muchas herramientas nuevas....pero son excelentes , lo bueno es que se estan dedicando a mejorar las herramientas anteriores...lo que es mucho mejor todavia	5
most people seem to like the soundtrack from " glory " , but this fact does not necessarily make " glory " a great , or even good soundtrack...most people also like the food served atmacdonald 's , but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...it is something to put in one 's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...the same might be said regarding " glory " ...if one 's tastes run to choir music , almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...as for the themes , they are commonplace variations , often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer , or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores , so , all in all , the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap , " homestyle " diner...the film , on the other hand , was well done , and , apparently , from reading many of the other reviews here , the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself , rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.horner has written a lot of really , really beautiful and original scores , but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...so , in sum , we are left with a very popular film , provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer	4
i liked this movie when i first saw it and i seen it about 10 times.. . i like to watch any movie that involves gangs ( especially bloods & crips ) so i can learn from them.. . if you 're looking or are just a collector like me of gang movies.. . you may not want this one in your collection.. . becuase to me , it does n't show enough bloods & crips in it... . the characters are fictional....there are some minor gangs in it as well called the white fences ( latino / hispanic gang - i 've never heard of this gang , so i do n't know if they are true or not . ) . the actors who play the gang members of the white fences are good actors though.. . i think they are better then don cheadle and wayans who play crip members.. . this movie centers more on white fence and their rivalry w / crips.. . there 's not too much focus on bloods in here.. . it also more focuses on sean penn 's character and robert duvall too ( good cop / bad cop ) , and penn on how he falls in love w / a former gangmember woman in the white fence gang . colors is a good watch...i just wish it had more gang focus in it...and more gang sets ( chapters , i.e. eight tray gangsters , hoover , etc.. . ) if you 're looking for a good gang buy , buy the book " monster " by sanyika shakur a.k.a. monster kody scott , or " do or die " by leon bing . those 2 books far surpasses this movie. .	2

ca n't really add much to the reviews . this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older . i 'll admit that when this came out in ' 94 , i only bumped the singles . it did n't grab me at the time . sometime around ' 97 i gave it a spin and i 've been loving it ever since . there are plenty of bangers on the album , but classics like " pour out a little liquor " , " str8 ballin ' " , " how long will they mourn me " , cradle to the grave " , and " under pressure " make this album worth owning all by themselves . the rest of the songs are on point too - - there is n't much filler on this album . the production is handled by warren g . & nate dogg ( 1 ) , the awesone yet underrated easy mo b ( 1 ) , johnny j ( 1 ) , jay & mopreme ( 1 ) , jay & syke ( 1 ) , stretch ( 1 ) , and thug music ( 4 ) . i 'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks . the only tracks that i would call skip material are " sh** do n't stop " and " do n't get it twisted " . " sh** do n't stop " is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive . the production is on " do n't get it twisted " cool , but it 's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it ( in my opinion ) . volume 1 is a passionate , if at times misdirected , release from the thug life camp . the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 's cali vibes . it holds up very well 13 years after its release . of course , if you 're a tupac completist , you probably have this album already . but even if you 're not a pac fan , this should be a part of your collection . r.i.p. tupac standout tracks : how long will they mourn me feat . nate dogg , pour out a little liquor , str8 ballin ' ( my favorite ) , cradle to the grave , under pressure , bury me a g feat . natasha walker ( of y.n.v. )	4
a quick search in amazon books under the name " benjamin franklin " comes up with 2403 matches . based upon that criteria , many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about ben franklin has been said . those people would be emphatically wrong , as has been proven by author and historian h.w. brands in his work on franklin , the first american : the life and times of benjamin franklin . brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in american history , back to life , once more , in this book which was a pulitzer finalist in 2002. this book is not only about franklin , but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters . brands brings the friends and acquaintances of franklin to life , ranging from cotton mather to sir isaac newton . the book also spans the life of franklin from his humble beginnings in boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of american society and government . i believe this is the finest biography written on franklin since van doren 's pulitzer prize winner of some seventy years ago . of course , a book about franklin would be incomplete without also being about the creation and formation of america , as the two are intricately attached . but brands ' work here is all inclusive , giving us not only the politics of franklin , but his creative genius , business sense and so much more we 've grown to appreciate about this senior statesman in american history . i have no idea how many biographies i have read about benjamin franklin , but this is definitely one of the best ever . h.w. brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative , meticulous detail and is one of the few franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to franklin 's human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status . monty rainey www.juntosociety.co	0
but not the only one you should get . make this a purchase , but get live / dead also because it has all different songs , and then look at other live releases . the dead have a lot of good recordings , just pick and choose among them . this one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection . it is amazing how many good songs they have , and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff , but you ca n't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it is n't up to scratch	4
on reciept of the tripod , i found it wrapped and packed ( on the outside ) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product . when i opened the box , i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box . there was minimal packing around the tripod itself , mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching , and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around . i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping . also , if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company , instructions are not part of their package	1

i did n't think it was possible for the delays to top their debut release - but they have . while " faded seaside glamour " is more immediately catchy and refined , " you see colours " comes at you in a much more intense manner . the songs are more mature , the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies . the high points for me are valentine and winters memory of summer , but there 's honestly not a bad track on this release . the delays put it all together - great songwriting , strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody . it 's a shame these guys do n't get more recognition here in the states . buy it	4
the earlier reviews pretty much said it all ; this is pretty much one of the best and most overlooked bands from the 90s . swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often , however , if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band , because they are n't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock . yes , rock . who knew it could still be done , and believe me , they do it well , and uniquely . if you 've listened to swervedriver before , then tehre is n't too much more to say - buy this album . it 's not as hi-fi as 99th dream or mezcal head ( in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade ) , but not as fast or dirty as raise . now , if you have never listened to swervedriver , this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes . personally , i would suggest starting with 99th dream or mezcal head ; either way , this has all the qualities of every swervedriver album - great lyrics , superb and unique songs , and that urge for more when it 's over . sadly , this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together ( however , some vestiges exist in the form of toshack highway ) . but if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so , if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - swervedriver is a must	4

david lean 's " the bridge on the river kwai " like jean renoir 's " grand illusion " is an anti-heroic war film , set in a prisoner of war camp environment.. . but there , the point of resemblance came to an end.. . " the bridge on the river kwai " is an adventure film in which the nature of world war ii is explored.. . and if in " grand illusion " the characters were described by a great artist who treasures their common humanity , in " the bridge on the river kwai " they are forced to carry out their destinies by an officer who cannot bear to see his bridge blown up.. . escape is almost impossible from the japanese camp located near the kwai river in burma.. . the prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards.. . the camp commander is a rigid psychopath.. . conditions are hard to bear.. . psychological state of the war british prisoners in constant alteration.. . into the presumptuous situation comes colonel nicholson ( alec guinness in a fascinating performance ) , a strict , serene , dedicated british officer , deeply concerned for the welfare of his men.. . nicholson is under severe pressure from the stubborn japanese colonel saito ( sessue hayakawa ) for insisting on his attachment to the geneva convention and refusing to allow his officers to be used on the construction of the strategic bridge.. . nichilson survives the oppressive punishment imposed on him , but his obsession has risen to near-madness.. . he agrees to help the japanese build their bridge , and in his determination to find victory in defeat , he ignores that the bridge , which he insists must be a ' proper bridge , ' will serve the japanese objectives against the british troops.. . in addition to the powerful rules of a prison camp picture , captors against captives and an interesting moral respect to a military code , a third element , in the story , is introduced : a small commando team led by major warden ( jack hawkins ) and an american sailor ( william holden ) whose mission is to destroy the strategic bridge. . the film leads swiftly to a suspenseful climax : a japanese train and a commando force directed to a same goal , the brige of the river kwai.. . each character , in the motion picture , has a valid reason for what he is doing , and each elaborates a relationship to the bridge revealed to be obsession and insane.. . " the bridge on the river kwai " hits with ' war ' in a compelling logic of events , the indulgence of self-destruction . with a great visual beauty and terrific whistling tune march , " the bridge on the river kwai " is a great dramatic entertainment of the wills of men.. .	2

i just finished a 4 day golf tournament that was brutal . 6 hour rounds played in 90 degree heat with high humidity . during a practice round a couple of days before the tournament started i really got drained of energy after about 12 holes . i was unprepared and it made a sport that i normally enjoy into an unpleasant experience . for the tournament rounds i packed a small cooler with gatorade , nature valley fruit and nut bars , and chocolate flavored clif builder 's bars . i drank water and gatorade throughout each round and alternated the bars every 3-4 holes . it really made a difference . each day i felt like i had the energy and endurance for a great round . if only my golf game was as good as these bars . they tasted great and keeping them in a cooler kept them from melting in the heat . i highly recommend chocolate clif builder 's bars . kevin decke	3

this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860 's narrated by a civil war deserter . within the first few pages , our hero enlists , pilfers letters off battlefield corpses , deserts , is injured in nyc draft riots , ends up in new bedford , ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going . the book was downhill from there . page after page described ice and the crew 's interminable struggles to get through . getting through the book was nearly as interminable . the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him , or really understand him at all . thus , his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles . there are elements of fantasy in the book . not enough to make it a fantasy , but enough to steer a reader off course . the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic . he is mad or it 's fantasy , it is hard to know until the end . there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands ( the most likeable character in the book ) describes how he got his third hand . from that yarn comes the title " rope eater " . the title really has nothing to do with the book , other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain . besides the tedious turning of the plot , the characters lack any development . only the three handed man and the captain , both tangential characters , had any depth whatsoever . this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure , but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension . it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened . although the reader knew the characters must be suffering , it never came through the over-writing . as one might expect , the crew 's mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless . so was this book . it was a disappointment .	0
this book devotes from 4 to 9 pages to every american president . each individual section includes a brief summary of the president 's successes and failures while in office . the " secrets lives " aspect includes a description of his temperament , character and personal habits . for example , john adams is said to have been vain and irritable , while frankin pierce is depicted as an alcoholic . also much oddball trivia is mentioned , such as that george washington had dentures made of hippo bone rather wood . the biographical information is at least somewhat educational , especially on the lesser known presidents such as millard fillmore and zachary taylor . but most people who study history will already known much of what is written here . the truth is that o'brien is not an actual presidential historian with scholarly credentials . but rather a freelance writer who apparently just read a few books , such as " the reader 's companion to the american presidency , " and then gathered together the bits he thought would be the most scandalous and entertaining . also o'brien provides no original research and some of what he reports as being factual is still subject to debate among scholars . however , what i found most disturbing about this book is o'brien 's tone and attitude . his so-called " humorous style " is basically a series of lame wisecracks and insults directed against the various presidents , especially those he dislikes . for example , he jokingly suggests that andrew jackson had " some unknown frontal lobe damage " . i have no problem challenging the policy decisions of a particular president . in fact , i disagree with much of jackson 's presidential agenda , especially his bigoted policies directed against american indians . however , i also think it is possible to have political disagreements without resorting to the sort of cheapshots that o ' brien uses . overall , i found the book to be juvenile , mean-spirited and overly negative . there are many better researched and well written books on presidential history out there . so do n't waste your time on this one .	0
i was very pleased with my order . the book was in excellent condition and i received the book in a timely manner . i would definately buy from this seller again	0
i bought this software because i really wanted to learn spanish and be fluent . the price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market . so i was very excited to receive it after spending $450 on a software . my excitement did not last long after that . i was shocked to see how the software itself looked , i was expecting a top of the line interface for the price i paid but that software seemed years old . but i still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours , even days , as i was convinced i could learn spanish with it . i also tried the other 2 levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level . i had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the 4 pictures . i was expecting different exercises for the full version...the software gets so repetitive , i was really disappointed , even more because of the outrageous price of that package	5

especially when there 's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful . the songs are so cheesy , her voice is out of place in half the songs . it 's whiny , irritating , dull and at this point , i 'm not sure who 's more talented , her or her sister . they got the looks , sure , but there 's lots of pretty girls in this world , does n't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd . & that 's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album . & i 'm sorry jes , but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say	4
i 've been a fan of carol dweck 's scholarly work for years . her work on self-esteem , self-concept , and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools i 've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children , as well as in their own self-awareness and lives . i 'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone , rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of dweck 's research and ideas . i 'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students ( teachers and principals working with gifted learners ) , as well as to parents of high-ability children . dona matthews , ph.d . , director of the hunter college center for gifted studies and education , city university of new york	0
after reading the trilogy , i was left wondering what the hell happened ? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker . pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i 've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy . there is n't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess . if you look up ` anticlimax ' in the dictionary , you 'll see a picture of this book . from first page to last , time is wasted on boring characters , while all the good ones are either killed off , or just mia for the entire book . spoilers ahead . what about lyra and her parents ? somehow , she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl ? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations . and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops . over a cup of tea , naturally . and that 's it for him . in addition to all that , this book does n't even seem to be connected to the first two . none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends , will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages . what happened to the story , for cripes sake ? ! and what happened to the ` temptation ' ? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it ? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with . as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries did n't endanger the universe , why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other . the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another . supposedly , they had more than gonads going for them , they survived death together ! pullman did n't feel like thinking it through , he just wanted a gut wrenching ending . in addition to that , he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the ` reality ' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning . all of will and lyra 's efforts are futile , kind of like - guess what ? religion for the rest of us morons . after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever , ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper . iorek byrnison , lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun . pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter ! this is not children 's literature , it 's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess . it 's totally dishonest to sell this as a children 's book , or even as a competent work of fiction . all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one . we never get closure on lyra 's parents . we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from . we never see will reunited with his mother . we get a lame battle where ` god ' dies and no one even knows why or how . lyra and will fall in love , but have to ` sacrifice ' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever , with only flimsy reasoning behind it . the mulefa and mary malone 's work together amounts to nothing , everyone just goes home . presumably , will goes home , although we never see it . all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing . the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon ? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea . it all just sort of disovles . mary forgot to be the serpent , or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa . another reader pointed out : " phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series . instead , the story falls flat under the weight of the author 's own agendas and mockeries . what a waste of time . i ca n't believe this book actually won awards . it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly . " it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream . instead , relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime . absurd . this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life .	0
the book is set up with an activity for each letter of the alphabet . the activities can be used in any order , which works for teachers who want to integrate this into their existing curriculum . the reproducibles are quality learning material , yet still entertaining for primary students	0
my girls bought this for their step dad for his birthday . he wo n't even listen to it any more because he has to reset the station every time he turns it on . we can never find the station we like without having another radio on to find it . the main reason he quit listening is because after i spent time trying to set the station in the morning , during his shower the station would automatically change to another one , give me a break ! this is a worthless radio , it does n't even deserve 1 star	3
i 'm an electrical engineer and in the telecomm buisness . i 've read a lot of books on communications and this has to be one of the worst , luckily i did n't pay for it . the writing is poor and it does n't commuicate ideas clearly . there is better books out there on the exact same subject	0

i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery . i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure , but was very disappointed in this outing . the characters were one-dimensional . after discovering who the " bad guys " were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification . sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters . " ...they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours . " even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted . i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold , but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	0
this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai	5
i purchased this book at walmart , which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology . it was cheap and on the clearance rack . i should have know better . when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books , the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one . after borrowing and reading the first two , i realized what a sham this series truly is . first , i realize they are supposed to be fictional . however , when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise , the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate . additionally , when usurping a mythical name such as shambala , one should know what the actual mythology entails , instead of making up one 's own notion of what is involed . shambala is not the same as shangri-la . shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture . shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield 's imagination . also , beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies . as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books , they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures , but they must never be mixed together . it just does n't work	0
ga . how can anyone stand this drivel ? worst movie i ever watched repeatedly . worse than watching " walk tall " 8 times in a row . worse even than watching the home shopping network . eww . eww	2
i was delighted to see more than one shower scene . all natural . different body types . you will not be disappointed	2
this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card . it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap . there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
it 's exactly what i wanted to buy : complete collection of ultimate x-men . i do n't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture . the ads were kind of annoying though . i just hope marvel puts all the other x-men series on cds like this	5
being a flight attendant myself and looking through the skymall magazine countless times on long flights i can tell you...this book is amazing . i have never laughed so hard from a book all my life . i really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge . i 'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it :	0
no moving parts contrary to depiction above . the " attachments " are tiny plastic 1.5 " knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet ! they do not move . there is no massaging action - you do all the work , making your hips and knees sore . the " massaging foot beds " are totally motionless and form a spiky , painful surface . vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device . jets are totally underpowered . no fill line indicator so " bubbles " spill water onto floor . heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different . cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads . classic deception in advertising	3
i should first state that i am a huge ej fan . his music has been extremely important to me over the years . he is , without a doubt , a genius ... i would go so far as to call him the mozart of our times . but , elton can also write bloated , self-indulgent tripe , and if you ask me , this album belongs in that bucket . i give it 2 stars just because of ssmlt , one of his all-time greats . i never cease to be blown away by that song . but the rest of this album ? booooooring ! ! !	4
i loved what the bleep ? and i specifically wanted to learn more about ' creating your day' . this video teaches nothing about how to create your day - nothing . it 's just ramtha ( jz knight ) talking about the fact that you can create your day . i heard you in the movie ! i bought this to give me some additional insights into how to create my day . it does not teach any how whatsoever . do not buy this video ! buy " the secret " @ thesecret.tv . buy " the attractor factor " by joe vitale . buy " wealth beyond reason " by bob doyle . do not buy this video	2
i was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed , because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it	3
i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best . strong motor , easy adjust , strong vacuum . other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me . one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard... . the idea is to glide the unit over your beard.. . you 're not raking , you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use . the waste receptacle snaps out easily , as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	3
now that i 'm writing this review , it seems silly that i 'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i had my first ( and hopefully only ) root canal and crown four years ago , something which i never again want to experience in my life ( as someone else described , it was painful and expensive ) . growing up , i did n't take care of my teeth like i should 've , so i 'm accustomed to always being told there 's either a cavity , or the start of one , and having to have more work done . after the root canal , my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations / oscillations , because that 's what she 'd been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , and it was affordable . when i first started using it , my gums were very sensitive to it , but that quickly wore off , so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums . it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth . subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high-quality electric toothbrush such as this one ( i honestly do n't remember if she has this exact model , but ours are similar ) , and i 've not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from " gunking " up , i 'm the only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in , not dripping into the storage container ; so i do n't know how to combat that . but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it , then rinse the hand-held part , and set them back on the unplugged charger / base ( i only plug it in when the battery runs low ) and things stay clean with no problem	3
attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move.. . none of my access 97 programs work now.. . in fact i , i brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions.. . nope.. . the upgrade just did n't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right.. . save your money on this product. .	5
i do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment . but i simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it . this is called censorship , and it gives me the creeps . as a parent , i have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children . so to realise that somebody has been cheating on me , trying to do my job so that i did not have to explain how society has evolved , how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud . this review is about the harper collins edition , edited by patricia c . and frederick l . mckissak , illustrated by michael hague	0
read some reviews that say " my cousin lost 100 pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day , " and ask yourself - would n't that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day ? ! this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value . if you wo n't drink water and exercise unless you have " special " water imbued with mythical powers , than by all means , this is the product for you . but if you prefer to save your money , simply exercise , eat healthier , and drink regular tap water	3
i do n't see the comparison to jeff buckley at all ! that was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album . all the songs are much too similar , the guy 's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and , if you remember london suede , has a very similar sound to them ( though i will say that london suede was much better ) . no one has come close to the pipes of j . buckley ( or even tim b . , for that matter ) in years and this does n't count any where near that , either	4
the paper version is a real touchstone for the practice of all manner of applied mathematics . the cd-rom version belongs in the discount bin . here is why : 1 ) the cd-rom is edition 5 ; but edition 6 has been out for 4 years . 2 ) the dynatext software , which is needed to read / browse / search the book , is showing signs of age . it works fine on the computers of a decade ago but not necessarily on the machines of today . see the review of j.f.groote . the product is advertised as working on macs but will not work on most macs . specifically , it does not seem to work on either g4 or g5 hardware with os x , even under the so-called " classic " mode . i believe that the problem is that the browser is shipped as an executable that requires a specific architecture . it is usable under windows , but you might need to use one of the backwards-compatibility options to run the installer . it will not apparently run under any form of linux , the most recent ( and rapidly becoming the most popular ) transmogrification of unix . again , dynatext is put on the cd-rom as a binary executable ; if you are not using sunos 4 or 5 , solaris or sgi irix 5.2 then you can not use this product	0
ok , i imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal , but i am going to say it anyway . this little baby is way over priced , not to mention you need a lot more than just this to make it work . you need a wireless router ! ! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon to do about it and maybe we can start a revolution ! with cf cards in the 12gb range it does n't make sense that you would need this for capacity reasons ( i know those of you with the biggest and brightes 16mp that shoot in jpeg & raw on the highest settings just laughed at me ) , however where this item is worth it is if you want to immediately see your shots on a big screen or computer without having to take the shot , take out the card , etc. what i want is a bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it is possible . i would like canon to offer support for these compact flash cards so that i can immediately sync my bluetooth computer with my bluetooth camera . now that would make it so that when i am in the studio or shooting a wedding , i have the mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending on card and i do n't have to drag along a wireless router and i saved myself $700. get to it canon - i am waiting ! ! !	1
i love speilberg films , i really do , but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap . i just do not like it , its not my thing . i ca n't belive that richard dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense . if you want to watch it , then go ahead , we all have different tastes . however , if you want to see a real speilberg film , watch ones like duel , jaws , et , schindler 's list , jurassic park , the lost world : jurassic park , and the indiana jones trilogy	2
this movie is full of memorable scenes , although it 's probably been more than a decade since i last saw it . it 's suspenseful without being gory...the most memorable scene is one that is absolutely chilling without ever showing a drop of blood . and even though i 'd read the book and knew the outcome i was on the edge of my seat right to the finish	2
this is the worst company i have ever dealt with . they offer 30 day trial on this product , i was n't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and i 'm still waiting for the refund . i have called them 3 times , it has been almost 4 months now without a refund . i would never buy a nova product from this company again and i would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service	5
i have yet to read this book , however , so far the ***** average rating is quite suspicious.. . each one of the three *****-reviewers , does not have a single other review in their profile . i am at the stage where i am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads ' trading , so i would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real-life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book , to do everyone of the rest of us a favor , and post an honest review - please , we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w / the author or his publisher. .	0
being a huge blondie fan , i want to rate this one higher , but sadly i cannot . it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs , it feel very negligant too . i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco , but their calypso number on this one is so awful . they had lost it here . check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat. .	4
so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it......when i got it , its like " um.. . is that it ? ? ? " it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards.. . also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all.. . other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .	1
this book is total self-propogating hogwash . garbage . save your money , and your life , avoid this book like a big mac	0
i picked up the first volumne of these graphic novel series a while ago and i 've been trying to get the whole series ever since ! the concept is new and interesrting and the art is always great . animal farm was especially good because of all the twists in the plot line . nothing is as it seems to be ! take my word .	0
the price was the best i could find . ordering was hassle free and delivery was fast	5
i was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this , for hawk and bird watching . i had looked at swarovskis , but they were way out of my budget , nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution . these binoculars are crystal-clear , with sharp focus . the 42mm lens lets in lots of light , lots more than the 35 's i 've been using . i wear glasses and the twist - up - and -down eyecups are a blessing . there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm , nice because i always used to lose them . for the price , these ca n't be beat	1
well , this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots , but if you do n't have good lighting , you end up with pictures that are worthless . i suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the dx6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless . best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash . plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures . also remember that because you ca n't use the flash option , you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots . otherwise , this lens is excellent . it fits easily into my camera bag , is simple to attach ( with the lens converter of course ) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect . other than the inability to use my flash with the lens , i think it is great	1
though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one , the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs . at one point , the author actually defends episiotomies.. . she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her , and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth . it was both infuriating and saddening . if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little , this is cute . if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth , this is not for you !	0
unfortunately , i forked out $14 for this cd . upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed . being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green 's previous work . also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist . use this as sunday background music on a rainy day ; but do not expect to get the party started with this album.. .	4
why is dylan taking sole credit on an album featuring a fair percentage of other peoples song writing ? shame on you bob	4
i just started taking this pill because i do n't have time to eat at the job i was previously at . it helped a lot ! ! i did lose 8 pound in 1 week . but when i started an office job , i had more than enough time to eat , but i still kept up with taking the pill . it helps with my hunger , it really does . i used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than i can eat ! now since taking this pill i am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if i 'm starving like before . i agree with one of the reviews , if you still eat when you 're not hungry , this pill will not help you . you have to have the in mind that you want to help yourself eat better , slower and sensible portions .	3
i just got my new photo box today . i was so excited i opened it at work . then i took a picture of my wendy 's salad just to see how it looked . the quality of the pictures are excellent ( macro mode ) . light is evenly distributed . caution about the lights : the lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them on . i suggest for the shear sanctity of safety , shut off the lights between object / scene changes . the package arrived intact , the box was beat up a little , nothing major . when i opened the item , i noticed the camera stand had pierced the nylon on the bottom . this could 've been a bad / weak stitch , or may have happened during shipping , but nothing major was wrong , only that . besides , i can sew it ! overall , this is a great product , and is easy to setup and carry around . i 'd definitely buy again	1
i would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art . there are those that " appreciate " unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they do n't . . . just as the emporer 's subjects " ooh " ed and " ah " ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them	4
a great series concept - highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the american music library . ofcourse the originally withdrawn [w . new at-the-time funky people] & quot ; talkin ' loud. . &quot ; by jb ( i bought it retail ! ) is the highlight , along with the live & quot ; it 's my thing.. . &quot ; by marva whitney . ( yes , i saw mw sing it **l-i-v-e** at madison square garden in july , 1969 ) . the prev . unrel . bobby byrd track and vicki anderson 's contribution to the & quot ; cold sweat&quot ; session also reinforce the value for listeners	4
for real , you gotta give this man props . i repect him and his music , but it 's not my style . he still managed to make this a good album , so it 's all good . much repect .	4
the author not only argues for feminism , but she does so in a unique manner , and innovative approach by arguing for feminism across borders . she compares and defines literary and national borders . this book is extremely thorough on all aspects of chicana feminist writing available , by engaging historical theories as well as contemporary notions . to really grasp the experience , the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth , substance , truth and validity .	0
ok , maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much . the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera . both my 30d and rebel xt . if i am lucky enough it will fall off , get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory	1
i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii . we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated . i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what	1
i thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes , but i have to admit i 'm disappointed with the recipes and with what i 've baked from it so far . i was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter . i know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture , but i have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and does n't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the fudgy brownies . all three recipes tasted delicious , so i ca n't complain there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much - - way too much , and i even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . i consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now i 'm wondering if i should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up . i think it 's okay for a " base " cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients	0
most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good - i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd 's have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering ! i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music , just with different chords . in fact , if i was not paying specific attention , i could n't tell when one song ended and another started ! i enjoyed what i heard , but i was certainly expecting more from this cd - many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least , some variety seems to have been called for . disney has always included great music with their movies , running the gamut of musical styles such as classical , jazz , blues , and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high . i do , however , highly recommend mannheim cd 's in general - just not this one	4

i have not been able to put this book down since i received it . i have always dreamed of visiting italy , but until that time comes , i have been redecorating my home to reflect that dream . i now have a & quot ; tuscan kitchen&quot ; that makes me very happy to be in . i bought this book for new ideas , and also to confirm that the elements in my home already are the correct ones . i was thrilled to find these & quot ; tuscan elements&quot ; such as pottery , stones , tiles discussed throughout . and the photographs inspire me to pay attention to details . it 's all about the textures of the walls , the colors , how you display your ceramics....the pictures are beautiful . i may not get to italy any time soon , but this book helped bring my dream a little closer to home	0
after being an amature photographer via print film , i decided to try a digital camera - though i 've been leary about printing quality . i knew i could n't afford a digital slr , so i opted for a " snap shot " camera that i thought would have enough features to satisfy me . however , after having and using this camera for a year now , i am so disappointed in the performace - the flash is just way too much , its a washout . after being used to print and picture quality in my film slr ( cannon , i might add ) , i was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera , i wish i would have just saved my money for a digital slr .	1
this dvd-rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that i do n't know after watching every episode numerous times . i highly recommend this for friends fans of all ages , regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode . also , i love that the game can be played by only one person , for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few friends to keep you company	5
i like these guys alot.i own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live . i played this cd a few times liked it at first , but it did n't grow on me at all liked i 'd hoped.to cute for me , not spontaneous enough.i feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.just let it rip guys , that 's what you do best.thank god my brother bought this instead of me.i bought live at cow palace ( the dead ) great cd	4
i am by no means a computer idiot , i audit computer systems security for a living . i have had to contact customer support ( webchat ) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software . the install was on a brand new system ( windows xp pro ) , with all of the microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed . first pest patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an active protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes ( which you had to click to clear each one ) . second , the firewall would tell me i was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode . third , pest patrol never would run a thorough scan . i 'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the pest patrol gui , or that system resources was not available . i contacted the customer support and they told me that yes , sometimes pest patrol does n't work at all unless you use msconfig to disable all startup services ( systems.ini , etc ) reboot , run pest patrol , then use msconfig to enable the startup services . it was a canned reply during a live web session , which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people . i have n't tried out the third solution yet because i wanted to remind myself to write an amazon review . if you are looking for simplicity , or do n't know much about computers , look elsewhere . otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds . i 'll give it two stars , since it did n't cause my dog to choke , explode my house , or cause irreparable damage to clothing ( which is my one-star ) .	5
after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar , i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc . was n't worth the effort , i 'm afraid . velveeta on wonder bread-dull collection of acid jazz duds . not bad as background noise for your next dinner party , but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act . a pass for all but galactic completeists , if such an animal exists	4
i did not get the instructional dvd , so i was left with a clipper set i did n't know how to use. .	3
if you 're looking for a good story with plenty of action and a great plot and you 're not really concerned with the difference between so-so writing and good writing ( this book is so-so ) , then this is an excellent book . i couldnt put it down . i gauge the rating of a book by one thing ; am i able to truely come into the story ? i am able to do this if the writing and word usage is at or above a certain level . i was able to " come into the story " when i read this book and to me , that provides for a good read . bad writing can prevent this experience but i did n't think this book was too badly written	0
i have used turbo tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone i purchased it at amazon . great price by the way . well i receive the product and try to load it and find out as of july ' 06 it is n't compatible with windows ' 98. now i have to send it to turbo tax for a refund . its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box . after a 45 minute call to turbo tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software . the online software was the same exact program i purchased from amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure . it sounds fishy and deceitful to me . i will never buy their software again !	5
i pass the exam this morning with 83 %. from total time i spend 70% time reading this book . this book is good if you have limited time to prepare for scjp . it does n't have boring description . the authors have done excellent job to extract out core concept from exam point of view . however , there are some typos and cds is not useful . i could n't able to access what is inside cds . anyway it was worth canadian $ 55 investment . i did refer khalid mughal book to clear some of the funda and practice examples	0
this razor is fantastic . the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream / gel would . but if you are looking for a quick , handy and yet still good shave , this is exactly what you are looking for	3
carl hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources . hoot is set in the seaside town of coconut cove . the plot revolves around mother paula 's pancake house , a fictitious restaurant chain in florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls . the developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records . unwary citizens applaud mother paula 's in coconut cove . the lone crusader for the owls is a boy nicknamed mullet fingers who lives in the backwoods dodging truant officers . he pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . mullet fingers enlists the help of his step sister , beatrice and new kid , roy . beatrice is a middle-school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . roy is a level-headed kid who moves to coconut cove from montana , earning the dubious title of cowgirl . when you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash roy you 've got a pretty good read !	0
for sheer excitement , you cannot beat this dvd . the music is exciting , arranged well for brass ensemble , and recorded with high quality . but that 's only the beginning.. . in blast , the band vigorously acts out all the pieces they perform . how they manage this energy level will flat-out amaze you . i can honestly say that , after just seeing these performances , you are as happily exhausted as the performers must be . prepare to be thrilled. .	2
if you are looking for boring , lifeless adult contemporary music , then this cd is for you . if you are looking for a great guitar cd , this is n't it . i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion , but all winning streaks must come to an end , and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this . of all the eric clapton cds that i like , this is n't one of them . i 'm glad clapton is now in a happy place ( and deservedly so ) , but this cd just does n't do it for me	4
...but i 'm giving season four 4 stars , because there are n't any subtitles in this set . they also did n't have subtitles for season 3 , but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 & 2. strange , huh ? however , the quality of the dvds are fine and the episodes , of course , are wonderful to watch . at the end of this season the meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good , but he decides to stay with the bunkers a little longer , so he can get his masters degree . there are n't any special features or anything in this dvd set , but as long as the episodes are uncut , i 'm happy . if you 're a fan of the show , this dvd set is a must-have !	2
i am realtively new to country music . i purchased this because i had the pleasure of hearing willie sing " you do n't know me " on cmt one afternoon . i was quite taken with his rendition and recalled hearing this song growing up . from this one time " soft rocker " i could n't be happier . go willie	4

this cd is absolutely wonderful . i am in australia so strawberry shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the usa , so you can imagine my daughters delight when this cd is being played . the songs are just gorgeous - i just wish they were a little longer . i thoroughly recommend this item to any little ss fans .	4
molly , daughter or richard - i usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time . why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s*** ? last year my hormones were all out of wack and i had a period for a whole month . i broke out severely as one would expect . dermatologists ( including mine ) swear by this aweful chetaphil . i hate it ! it wasnt strong enough for my skin . it made my acne even worse if you can imagine ! i 'd been using it for four months when i finally decided enough was enough and i started using neutrogena frangrance free facial cleanser . that change made all the difference in the world ! i still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne . now its mostly just old , light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period . one of my friends is a dietition and she also has used cetaphil and didnt like it at all . please do not buy cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it . you will totally regret it	3
eddie 's first all-studio recording , and the album that got me hooked . i must say that even though they are uncomparably fantastic live , this album demonstrates the range and diversity of eddie from ohio . & quot ; oh my brother&quot ; is a particular favorite with julie murphy wells displaying her amazing range and beautiful voice , and robbie schaffer 's talent for emoting the absolute best of a heartwrenching situation . if this song does n't touch your heart , you have no appreciation for music . a particular plus on this album is a beautiful violin solo of & quot ; yerushalyim shel zahav&quot ; by guest musician pete wilson on & quot ; jerusalem , & quot ; another song by robbie , this time also performed by him . as always , the amazing prowess of this group is displayed magnificently	4
over 90% of pictures i took by this canon are blurry . no way can you fix it . i really got fed up with it . waist your money . waist your time . more important , waist your precious moments !	1
this was my first yoga cd and i found it amazing ... i 'm addicted to it . i still cant tell whether its challenging for advanced yogis but as a beginner i really enjoyed it... . it does not have all that gibberish spiritual blab on one extreme nor power yoga that seems to really be pseudoyoga on the other extreme .. however this cd is just clear and to the point with good instruction excellent demonstration and fantastic sound tracks... . eric 's voice is soothing the instructions are clear and the crew is great . the length is convenient 45 minutes and music is hypnotic . the more i use it the more i feel stronger increase flexibility , breathe more calmly and improve my posture. . in other words dont hesitate just get it ! ! ! ! !	2
was given this book as a freebie- -someone must be buying up copies . for an austinite , this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness- -kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when louis the xiv 's chamber pot was carried by , except this is n't the sun king , guys . get a life , or at least an authentic artist to swoon over- -all of garriott 's stuff was strictly derivative . now that we have the real lord of the rings to watch , who cares about cheap imitations	0
i have two 8 " picture frames that are other brands , and they are great and i use them for open houses all the time ! i got this one as a gift from a friend , and it is terrible ! ! the instructions are difficult to understand . the wide screen makes everyone in the picture look fat and distorted ! this is a weird size and i am not happy at all ! ! i do n't recommend it	1
this dvd skips quite a bit , making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie . also , the plastic covering on the dvd casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off . i 've never had a movie do that before . i would think twice in the future before buying movies from amazon.com	2
i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$	2
this was a very revealing look into how steroids played a role in baseball player success starting in the 1980s . this was an influential book which began a congressional search into the use of steroids in baseball .	0
i honestly feel that tesla reached the end here . after " psychotic supper " failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart . with this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of kurt cobain , and here was tesla trying to make up it 's mind what way to go . with the opening track " the gate " it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80 's , but then the next song " solution " they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90's . the rest of the songs just followed suit . the groups slogan is " no machines " , but there 's also another slogan at foot here , and that 's " no music direction " , and for some bands that 's possibly a workable concept as long as there 's an inkling of where the bands roots are . with tesla it 's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song " signs " , which is a rock song , to where they do a cover here of joe south 's " games people play " . i feel that tesla failed to show thier influences here , and was just trying to make a living ; which is not a bad thing , but it pretty much kept them at a cult status . i pretty much had this album , but did n't listen to it at the time as i was trying to leave the secular music scene behind , and just move onto christianity , and i know the album lurked around in my head all this time , so i felt it was time to face it ; i feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs , and to me it seems they wanted out of the label , and possibly away from each other .	4
no problems . like the small format bottle , easy to store . works as well as anything else	3
this item is garbage ; i purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash . sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me , it 's not worth the frustratio	3
jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse . seriously , think about marc bolan trying to sound like a ' 50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like	4
shavers fall into two categories , those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers . for those of you who like foil shavers , this is the one for you ! i 've owned the latest braun 8985 and it was excellent , while it lasted.. . the charger kept breaking on me ( once in the first month [11 / 2006] , then another time 4 months later [3 / 2007] ) . it was expensive , and the refills were a pain , pricey , but they worked . after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco 8140xl ( speed xl ) rotaries , and while they shaved really close , they tore up my neck . the problem only got worse . returned 3 weeks later . i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors . they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos . i 'm not sure if i like the " side to side " pivoting head , only time will tell . the heads do n't pivot up and down as much as the braun , but once again , time will tell if this is necessary . one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water.. . no expensive refills to hassle over . the panasonic has two noticeable downsides : 1. it 's louder than other shavers , but who cares ? it shaves incredibly fast anyway . 2. you ca n't plug it in and shave.. . you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on . this is my favorite razor by far .	3

the setting of this book is beautiful , exotic , and interesting . the author , unfortunately , does nothing to take advantage of this . i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award . it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless , or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year - - which i doubt . the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else , as far as i am concerned . i ca n't imagine it being done worse ! tuck 's writing style - - short vignettes or episodes , one after another - - is terribly ineffective and disjointed . i felt completely detached from all of the characters . i did n't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were , and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies . another thing that completely irritated me were tuck 's sexual references . throughout the novel , tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter ( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest , for example ) . these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader ; all they did was gross me out . they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy , not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story . i do n't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel . i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level : it is not entertaining . it is not profound . it is not educational . it is not beautiful . at only 248 pages , i ca n't say it was even a quick read . utterly forgettable , once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it .	0
as a 21 year old , i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack . but , i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies . imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney 's parts were not sung by rosemary clooney ! i do not recommend buying this album . enjoy the music when you watch the movies , instead . trust me , it 's better that way	4
yes , it 's the bible of cooking . its like a degree at the culinary institute . however , its not an easy book to cook from . most recipes refer to several parts of the book for details on how to prepare different parts of the recipe . so you contstantly have to page back and forth in the book . its intimidating for the novice who just wants to cook , but if you really want to learn about cooking then its the book to have	0
i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning " killer angels , " and because i 'm a baseball fan . the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher . it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot . the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories . the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there . any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away , flaws that distract and damage the work . shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees . why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear . the hawks apparently are from atlanta , but an atlanta team , braves or hawks , whichever , would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season . finally , when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game , he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium- -not on the mound on the field . this book was published posthumously and mr. shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose- -prose that was excellent in " killer angels . " it 's unfortunate . there are glimmers of interest in the book , but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author 's other book	0
i purchased this camera from amazon recently . the first time around , the camera tape door would n't shut the very first time i opened it . i returned the camera and amazon was great about replcing it promptly . the second time around , the dv port worked once , and only once . there 's a short in it . there is a reason this camera is so cheap . it 's j u n k ! ! i will add that a friend of mine is on her second jvc as well . a fact i did not know until all of this came about . for two stars , i 'll say the video quality is good . the camera battery does hold a full 60 min . charge . i had no sound issues what so ever . background noise ? ? none here . as for still pictures , if you do n't know what you 're doing as far as shutter speeds , back light , etc. forget it . the still pictures are very grainy . if you want professional looking stills , do not buy a camcorder for this purpose . jvc tech support is useless . camcorder comes with a usb wire to upload still only . as on any digital camcorders , you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port . you need a firewire . this does not come with one . also , you need to check if you have a firewire port on your computer . i paid app . $25 dollars here on amazon including shipping , for a port and firewire . it took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower . it 's no big deal . amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time , only refund my money . this camera is now listed as $30 cheaper than when i bought it last month . overall , amazon was great about service and return , however , this particular jvc item is junk	1
with freddie backed by herbie , ron carter , and tony williams.this is high-flight crisp and inspiring music.worthy of repeated listenings . listen and enjoy.williams is over the top , very creative and will continue to suprise you with his unceasing inventiveness.i 've always noticed how carter and williams really spur hancock on as you will notice in this set.hancock , one the the truly great pianist of post-bop era , sounds like he is his having the time of his life.it does n't get much better than this .	4
this was a huge waste of money . if you have plans to make a custom animation , do not buy this . anime only alows you to manipulate one of their few charecters . you can not change eye color or hair color . if you want a good animation you have to go to one of their websites and purchase a character for $10 - $20. their free ones are completly dumb . using their " easy to use " bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use . it took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure . ( which did n't work very well ) you ca n't even group anything unless you buy their $180 upgraded version . i spent hours trying to use this , and could figure none of the above out . it also took two weeks to get here instead of four days . i do n't recomend this to people who are looking for an easy to use animation creator .	5
six degrees of separation is an outstanding play transformed to the screen with dignity but with a script that keeps us in the live theatre instead of in a motion picture . not that that is a bad thing : the script by john guare is brilliant . it simply seems a little static , with its marvelous plays on words , repeated phrases , and disjointed movements significant unto themselves but not really taking advantage of cinematic possibilities of flow . essentially the tale of how a married couple who deal art ( stockard channing and donald sutherland - both in peak form ) are so caught up in their superficial lives that they are taken in by a handsome young african american con artist ( will smith ) whose various antics bring the couple round to reexamining their shallow existence . most of the story is related over art dealings and dinner conversations and are peopled by such luminaries as kitty carlisle , ian mckellen , artists chuck close and kazuko , mary beth hurt , bruce davidson etc - a really fine ensemble . there are many social comments clustered in this story and it continues to play well after its origins on the stage and fifteen years after the movie was made . this was one of will smith 's entries into film as well as one of the gifted stockard channing 's finest roles . highly recommended for repeated viewings . grady harp , october 0	2
i have been a corel user for years . this latest version is a great improvement . esp for raster to vector tracing . i have always preferred to use corel over our illustrator even though i have both installed on my system . corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program . very powerful for anyone from novice to pro user	5
this is definitely the best ab workout . working in a desk job , i kept gaining weight around the ab area . after just two days of this dvd , i had results . it was incredible . the fat around my abs just kept shrinking and shrinking . i would recomend this to anybody . no matter how fit you are , there are four levels of difficulty . practically anybody can do the first level . i do all four . already i am seeing results . i hope he puts out more videos for upper body strength as well . cannot stress how fast the results are . you will probably see results within a week	2
all i wanted was a way to identify some files , remember which ones so every time i wanted to backup , i would press " go " and the backup would start . alohabob was too " smart " for my use . first , it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up . i indicate that i want to select my own files ( which it lets me think i can do ) . then thinking it would bring me to browser window - - no , no , no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if i had selected the " smart find " . i then manually select my files ( great ! ! ) . in trying to save the " template " of what files i wanted to backup , it requires that i make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency ( yuk ! ! ) . i want to back up when i get to it ( about once a month , not when it wants to - - i am backing up to a dvd which i need to put in the drive ) . ok , so now i am over that and the backup begins - great ! ! ! upon returning into the application a month later , i can not select my saved " template " to " run now " , it will run when it is scheduled to run : ( so...i need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up . i exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to " add " the features i described . oh well - it looked like such a promising product . now i need to find another that satisfies my requirements	5
i love the firm workouts , and i love the instructor allie , so i was so excited to try this new workout . i was unfortunately extremely disappointed . this workout was not complicated , but it also was n't much of a workout . i did n't get my heart rate up at all , and did n't break a sweat . some of the moves are just not very good , and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying . the disco part was my favorite , but overall , this is a workout that i can honestly say i would rather have the money then the workout . i will keep it and periodically do it on a very light day or in addition to another workout , but that 's just because i have it . i 've tried a couple other of the new firm workouts that are more worth the money...this one i am sad to say is not .	2

ageless body is deepak 's attempt to neutralize the word " old " as in old age . the writer has a knack for making common words , like " body , " mind " and " self , " into profound concepts . his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies . but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound . if you like poetry , deepak may be your read : " the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life ; ( p . 36 ) " or try to interpret this one : " the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe ; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born . ( p.40 ) " at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible . he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over " intelligent design . " he ca n't accept the growth of any cell , even a plant cell , without an intelligence involved . he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p . 115 , asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process . deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms : intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself . whether your word game tosses in the word " quantum " or not does n't change much . what a solipsistic thought ; what a solipsistic world . i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of would n't , after awhile , go insane	0
the author dwells too much on knife fighting rather than the knives . i found the book to be a disappointment	0
i have been using pc-cillin after dumping mcafee following some lousy customer support with no issues . this new version i was very concerned after reading all of the reviews . it does seem to slow things a little on my amd pc if i am running all of the options i can run but even with them it is tolerable . i am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple .	5

thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush , but no . my hair is long-ish and kind of fine / straight . the brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush . so , i could n't get the full volume results i wanted . i can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better . it is very loud though . i returned mine	3
i got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress . it was pretty pungent , but it felt so good the first time i layed in it . after a couple days it appeared to lose it 's memory and start to dent and crease , but eventually it got back to full expansion . the customer service with this item was fantastic ! we 'll see how long the matress keeps up its memory	3

i bought a new desktop pc installed with vista . it came preinstalled with mcafee 2007. i have been using norton products for years , so i bought a 3 user package of north internet security 2007. for the 60 days of the trial , my computer ran flawlessly . but it was time to install norton as mcafee had run its course . i installed the program last night , which took 45 minutes with the vista update from symantec , required updates , restarts and the full system scan . after this time my computer , which as i said ran flawlessly for 60 days , well now every 60 minutes i get the blue screen of death and a forced restart . i contacted symantec 's customer support only to be greeted with an hour and forty five minutes wait to chat with an analysts ( seems that i was not the only one with norton troubles ) . after all this time , the advice i was given was....uninstall and reinstall ! ! ! ! gee , einstein , i would have never done that already before i wasted my time contacting you . but the symantec analyst was firm that this was the problem . so i took my morning and uninstalled and reinstalled and...the same blue screen of death but now in under an hour of use ! ! ! i 'm uninstalling this virus and buying a mcafee package asap . oh also , during the time my computer was not crashing , it ran slow ! ! it is a 2.8 gig processor with 2 gigs of ram but it ran as if it were a 386 processor with 32 megs of ram . and everything you run , norton needs you to approve its connection...everything . you can allow norton to decide what can and cannot connect so you do not have to click every five second , but then you will not be able to user 1 / 2 of your programs as the geniuses at norton did not include them in their ` safe ' list . i regret buying this and only wish i could give it zero stars ! ! !	5

i first used this product when i got a straight razor shave in a men 's salon awhile back . it really made for a smooth shave , which you definitely need when getting a straight razor shave . by the way , i do n't recommend getting a straight razor shave on your wedding day as i foolishly did . your face will be very sore . it took me 10 years before i got another straight razor shave , and i hated it as much as the first time . i 'll never get another . however , this oil product made the shave tolerable , and it makes daily shaving fantastic . this combined with the aftershave moisturizer makes for an incredible shave . it 's amazing how soft your skin feels afterward . buy the oil and the moisturizing aftershave , and you wo n't be disappointed	3
this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet , so i bought this specifically for that use . i used the triangular pumice attachment only.i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate , but in general it 's just a vibrating ( 2 levels ) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually . the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference . the actual machine has no function . the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok , but can easily be used without this machine	3
i bought this a few months ago , and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly . it yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them , which is very painful ! it does n't pull them all the way out , which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue . sometimes it works okay , but what good is a razor that only works half the time ? others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it 's losing power . mine does sound " slower " when it 's yanking the hair , but that does n't seem to be related to battery charge ( e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode , and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in ! ) even when not pulling hair , the shave is not close . definitely find a different razor	3
this was a gift . it came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at . so we were happy	3
reviewer alianore 's opinion " rather too indulgent of its subject " is a very accurate portrayal of weir 's work . i will try to add something to that near perfect review . ( note : i listened to the unabridged audiobook of " queen isabella " , 22 hrs on 18 cds ) . the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable , loaded with period details . the last third is the worst : weir 's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation - - nay , elevation - - of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering , much-wronged , highly-deserving , and late-redeemed just queen of england . this book is really " subjective , rhetorical biographal dramatization " . i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis . it is rhetoric because of the endless " weasel words " ( and expressions ) used copiously throughout : " some say " , " it has been said " , " many believe " , " therefore we may assume " , " it can be inferred " ... this is n't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively . these expressions occur many hundreds of times , commonly in conjunction with wier 's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light , always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons . equally irksome is weir 's double-standard of historical psychological analysis . she is always ' declaring ' for us the contents of isabella 's thoughts . remarkable gift she has for this . many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful . but then moments later she will portray isabella 's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have , might have , could have , would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history . this is n't historical writing , it is historical op-ed , with an obvious agenda . i do n't loathe this work , it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail . the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing . but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography . ( other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris ' " rise of theodore roosevelt " and " theodore rex " . i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject , lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence . yuck . really . ) if prefer more history when reading ( or listening to ) history . and much , much less editorial subjectivity , retroactive psychology , biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation . the only way i could enjoy " isabella " by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly , taking it with " several pounds of salt " as the above referenced reviewer advises . 2.5 / 5	0
this is beck 's coming of age album . " loser " was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and " mellow gold " landed beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation . his earlier recordings , featured in an album entitled " one foot in the grave , " were evidence enough of his musical genius . " mellow gold " might have represented an electro-acoustic adolescence for beck . if that 's the case , then " mutations " was his rite of passage , a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue-in-cheek wittiness of his previous album . " mutations " has dark , brooding moments with haunting melodies . his lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness . in one song , he sings , " looking back on some dead world , that looks so new . " we ca n't always be sure of his references or implications , but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful . his ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful . with " mutations , " beck has secured an important place in music history . this is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play . the arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft .	4
well , i wrote the review about this set , and boy was i disappointed when i got it . i see that the company who produced it must have paid very little in royalties as there are numerous silent episodes and ones with the lesser caracters . 1 disc has spanky and alfalfa and the fifth is a sad attempt at filling out this collection . the transfers are terrible and the sound is worse . come on guys , at least try to put some effort into it ! ! ! i got the set , watched it&lt ; and traded it in at the local hock shop for something i could use . what a waste of money ! !	2
the battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge . i made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband 's dvd player and they were useless . what a waste of my money	1
" midway " was the decisive naval engagement of the second world war - - decided by a handful of bombs hitting the japanese carriers over a period of a few minutes . it is a riveting story that has been well told in several movies and innumerable books . not here . relying upon outtakes from " tora tora tora " ( and the wonderful japanese cast of that film ) what we have here is a pedestrian outing that should be avoided at all costs . quite honestly ? the best version of the battle of midway was steven spielberg 's original " star wars " ( before it had roman numberals _	2
this album has morse code on it , what more can you say.. . ...well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres , complete with t6 buzz and slow drift . and the music is pretty good too .	4
the case is beautiful leather . seems sturdy and well made . would have been more functional if the belt holder was open ended , i thought . i ordered it for my son , but found it very feminine when it arrived . i had to give it to someone else	1
this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g-funk heyday . warren g . did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard / soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before . the skits are ridiculous , the music is halfass , and the lyrics are amateur . there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album . this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w.c. and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's " it takes a thief " . one star for the hit single " summertime in the l.b.c. " .	4
no diggity was a monster hit in 1996. if you love this album you will also love michael jackson 's dangerous , which was also co-produced with teddy riley , the lead singer of blackstreet	4
i agree with m. arse with the 2star rating . i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning . not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light . i 'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers . i 've read that it has much better shutter speed . recommended ? ?	1
i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack...they are horrible pieces of s$# ! ? * &%# ! #$ ! there are a couple good ones , but its not worth spending the money on for the c.d , not even at a used price.i ca n't believe they did'nt put " low rider " on the soundtrack , how cheap is that	4
there are only two artists ' music that i will purchase not having heard one note of the cd . those two artists are barbra streisand and linda eder . " songs of judy garland " was a huge disappointment . i was surprised at the cd cover . i do n't know what " look " ms. eder was shooting for but she missed the mark . instead of coming off as 10 years younger , she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable . she looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child . ms. eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of " makeover " . and the music...i tried so many times to like it . but the more i listended the more i realized i was listening to " liza minnelli " singing her mother 's music . i did not hear linda eder . i 'm begging you ms. eder , go back to what works . i 'm sorry...this does n't	4
i saw transamerica months ago and i still think about it . there are many reasons , most obviously felicity huffman 's portrayal of bree , a man determined to become a woman , trying to close the door on his past , just as it unexpectedly reopens to disclose an heretofore unknown and decidedly lost child . but transamerica also brings a funny , poignant , and at times visually beautiful road trip across the united states , in an old car that you wonder how it could make 50 miles , let alone 3000. it brings unexpected and uncertain romance . it brings out humanity in all its characters ( save one minor one ) , including bree 's bitter mother . finally , it - - plot spoiler here - - concludes with tentative reconciliation , acceptance , and an uncertain but potentially hopeful future . transamerica is not loud , not big budget , not spectacular , but there are few movies near as good as it .	2
i purchased this game for my 3 year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well . i hoped this game would help her learn addition . she loves to play it , but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability ( the hand cart one in particular , as noted by another reviewer ) , and catching bubbles . it was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not " execute " because her movements were too slow . over time , she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one . the game is very engaging ang the graphics well-done , but the educational part is under-emphasized . the game that " teaches " addition involves frogs jumping to lily-pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed	5
what has happened to the song " lives in the balance " on this set ? if you go to his website it sounds really great ! ! ! on this set it sounds awfull ! ! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with . the packaging if you could call it that is really lame . foam dots for holders ? what do you do when those fall off ? i suppose you put the cd 's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up . not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work ! true you do get alot of songs for the money but , there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it . if you own an i-pod i suggest you go to apples i-tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less	4
the chocolate war the chocolate war was one of the best books i have ever read...not ! the chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene . the boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused , but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot . i would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate . i do n't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level . this story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out . i think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of archie . archie is a suspicious character that knows every one . i wish this book was more school appropriate , but it is n't and was a horrid book . therefore , this book would be great if the author published a book with the sam story but more school appropriate situations and words	0

the reading magnifiers i ordered 09 / 29 / 04 finally arrived 10 / 19 / 04 after a call to the seller . ( original order was shipped to amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me . ) it only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers , and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm . the weighted base does keep it from falling over . unfortunately , the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device . if the user turned the adjustment knob too far , it and the nut that holds it together would fall off . the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device . the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw . presumably the device is for someone with low vision . if the small nut falls to the floor , i 'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it . my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens... . and if possible , try the device out before buying .	3
it kept me guessing till the end ! i did n't want to put it down . the only part that i would have changed would have been that the one lady would have lived . ca n't wait to read her next book .	0
excellent camera kit . versatile . i have a lot to learn about the camera , though , as it is no simple point-and-shoot . however , in auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward to learning how to use it fully . lenses came with warranty cards , but the camera itself did not . i bought the sb-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 gb compact flash cards to round out the kit . camera with lens attached is large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag is too small for it all . great camera , though . price was the best i could find anywhere	1
undoubtedly the worst ' best of ' dvd ever made , even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd . if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift . there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror , but it ca n't be for the actual dvd . there are n't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds . shame on the band for putting this out . obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a ' best of ' on dvd . this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture . my taped videos on vhs from mtv and vh1 sound and look better than these ones , really . this essay in amatuerism may have some interest . for worse , is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 's to 2000. ' love is blindness ' , ' walk on ' , ' elevation ' and several alternative videos were edited out . did n't they have another filmed version of ' gone ' ? . mexico city 1997 was just a below average performance . shame on u2 for keep going with ' gone ' from that bad shaped bono 's rough night . i still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song . im talking about ' until the end of the world' . in case you dont know , theres an actual video clip from that song . rather , they just put the well known sidney 1993 version here . rumors say they 're going to release a dvd boxset by late this year . i really do n't want ' remastered ' versions of shows we 've been watching for even 22 years . rather , i 'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage . just in case , here 's a list of several unreleased pro-shot filmed concerts from early 80 's to pop mart tour ( i did n't include elevation because there 're 2 dvd 's out there from the same tour ) . cheers 1 - belfast 23-01-1981 ( awesome concert ! ) 2 - berlin 04-11-1981 ( great goncert ) 3 - new york 22-11-1981 ( good concert ) 4 - hattem 14-05-1982 ( awesome concert ! ) 5 - roskilde 02-07-1982 ( awesome concert ! ) 6 - devore 03-05-1983 ( great concert ) 7 - st. goarshausen 20-08-1983 ( awesome concert ! ) 8 - dortmund 21-11-1984 ( awesome concert ! ) 9 - montreal 27-03-1985 ( great concert ) 10-los angeles 18-11-1987 ( awesome concert ! ) 11-dublin 31-12-1989 ( awesome concert ! ) 12-stockholm 11-06-1992 ( awesome concert ! ) 13-washington 16-08-1992 ( great concert ) 14-anaheim 14-11-1992 ( awesome concert ! ) 15-dublin 28-08-1993 ( awesome concert ! ) 16-adelaide 16-11-1993 ( great concert ) 17-rotterdam 18-07-1997 ( awesome concert ! ) 18-sao baulo 31-01-1998 ( great concert ) 19-santiago 11-02-1998 ( awesome concert ! ) what the hell are u2 waiting for ?	2

this album is disgusting . no musical talent . this people are the farthest thing from musicians . if you enjoy overproduced music , and a rip off of fellow label mates fob and p ! atd - buy this . it is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record . shaant ca n't sing either . go back to buffalo	4

this is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball , as far as i can tell . if you follow the directions , and are as close to the action as possible , and at a " straight on " angle , it looks like its correct in the + - 1 mph statement . however , this is a cool gadget , but if you are serious about " speed " and would like more versatility , then your going to have to go with the official mlb jugs gun...but at a much higher price . good luck	1
i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . for a starting photographer , the price was right , and i have not noticed any quality issues . the uv filter stays on a lens at all times , as it 's cheaper to replace the filter , than it is to have a scratched lens element repaired . the light polarizer is very handy , and also works very well , cutting down greatly on glare . i have not yet had the occasion to use the warming filter yet . the filter case is a nice extra , it fits right in my camera bag , and is out of the way untill i need it	1

i agree almost completely with jwalker019. this ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950 's and gianni s . is downright embarrassing . the costuming there makes everyone look absurd . tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good . angelica is okay but it is not a part for plowright and i definitely did not like dunja vejzovic as the princess . it is great to have this opera on dvd but otherwise it was a big disappointment . no goosebumps here . i just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the met broadcast with scotto in all three of the 1 acters . what a delight - - some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that 's what these need . scotto was incredible in suor angelica . we should be so lucky to have these performances released on dvd but that is highly unlikely . i 've given this la scala dvd 2 stars but that is probably being generous	2
in this book , dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history . he focuses primarily on the catholic church . from dulles ' analysis , there are five basic ways to understand the church . he explores how these models have been used over time , as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses . in the rest of the book , dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology . he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five . my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward . rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models . the book is helpful , however , to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church . it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church . all things considered , this book is an asset to pastors , students , and anyone involved in ministry	0
received the dxg-506v yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount . many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam . this is kind of like false advertising . this is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices ( like the optimus that radio shack sells ) and there is also no image stabilization . geez , how hard would it have been to put a simple ¼ inch plastic mount on the bottom . as for sound , the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting . you can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting . that is pretty bad . the resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970 's cassette tape recorder . the best thing this cam has going for it is that it can save movies in avi , mov or asx format at different resolutions which is why i got it in the first place . it is also pretty easy to learn and its buttons and functions seem fairly logical . it also has a lens cap . my advice to dxg is this . 1. add a tripod mount . 2. move the microphone forward and do something about that hiss and tinny sound or perhaps add a mic jack so that i can use an external microphone . that would be sweet . 3. improve the cam so that it will do a better job in normal indoor lighting situations . the optional settings do nothing to improve this . i tried them all . bottom line is that i would have kept this cam if it had a tripod mount . there are just too many situations that this comes in handy and it would have allowed me to add a light to the cam for indoor use .	1
i have been a long time user of delorme products but decided to get a combination of microsoft products both for the us and europe ( autotrip ) . the program loaded very smoothly , but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the gps locator . there are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you do n't follow directions . i loaded all the data on my laptop so i would not have to carry the dvd . the setup was also quite simple . there are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use ( as well as the cautions during setup ) . one needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving . i set the mapping program and forget it . but it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate . the gps locator has a great chipset . very , very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds , even as i sit in my house . it rarely loses a lock on the satellite . the route finding works well , so far . you can save your track as well as the route , but unlike the delorme products you ca n't playback your track ( or if you can , i have not found it ) . the screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen . i have n't tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average . the ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus . plus you can routinely update road construction sites . so far , no opinion on how good that feature is . the microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though i 've only tried it at home . it routinely thinks i 'm in china ( which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where i am ) . the gps also works with other programs by selecting a generic nema gps . there are other optional equipment to go with the gps . if you 've never used a gps mapping program with a laptop , microsoft s&t is a good choice . just do n't be surprised if the gps lcates you accurately and the microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet .	5

hate to say it , but this is pretty drab stuff . that said , i 'm hardly about to complain ; how could i ? this was obviously written for a film ( that i have no interest in seeing ) , and mogwai just released ' mr. beast ' , a solid ( if unspectacular ) album earlier this year . i kind of see ' zidane ' as a gift , then . looking at the whole thing from that perspective , it 's impossible to be letdown . but then , retaining much emotion out of this composition is downright difficult . mogwai , when channeling the right energies , create sublime , beautiful music - - truly as beautiful as any form of modern music , to my ears . when they 're a bit more ambiguous , though , the results tend to float in limbo and lack direction . ' zindane ' seems to possess certain elements of both these characteristics to an extent , but the result is surprisingly dull - - at best , it 's pretty ; at worst , it 's utterly monotonous . the ideas are here , too ; it 's not that ' zindane ' lacks drive or intent . it is a focused work . yet , it 's obvious , i think , that the music , contrary to most film scores , desires to refrain from emotional manipulation . while that 's admirable , i find that musically , i 'd much rather be manipulated than dazed ; this is literally music to listen to whilst on painkillers . there are a few nice themes and motifs , do n't get me wrong , but this is all underscore - - mogwai , in the best way possible , has a great gift at handling melodrama , and here they never appear to be guided by the dramatic light . i wo n't sway anyone from attempting to get ' zidane ' , but i would n't hand it out to anyone unexposed to mogwai in some hopes of garnishing their admiration . no , for that , i would naturally lead them to one of their many fine studio albums . for , mogwai is a band , after all - - they are not jerry goldsmith or ennio morricone . for those unaware , mogwai performed much of the score for the recently released film ' the fountain ' - - though they did not write any of the actual material , from what i 've gathered - - and as a musical experience , the soundtrack release for that album absolutely blows ' zidane ' out of the water . in my opinion , it even beats out ' mr. beast ' , so impatient fans who need a fresh dose of mogwai ' oughta check that one out for sure	4

i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea . i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them . each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way . i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense . the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it...i was n't shocked , disturbed or upset.........just bored	2
i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also . this book is filled with suspense from page one . the book never drags in my opinion . this book though is not for the faint of heart . if you do n't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter . but if you do n't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes . the ending is by far the most suspenseful part . i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about . the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also . i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't . i ca n't choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it . although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end . keep up the good work king	0

i thought this would be a good product for my computer . i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download . during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove ( uninstall / delete ) all of your known antivirus , spyware , and firewalls from your computer prior to install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message . i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download . i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support , they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue . they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support , those that know the basics and those that know more . they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over the next two weeks , all of them were outside of the specified time . i missed several of them because i have a career and a life . when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue . here it was , two weeks after i purchased the software , i still did not have what i needed . i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software . i called in several times druing the ordeal and the " teir i " agents just told me that i have to wait for the call , " they 'll get to it when they get to it . " i was very upset with the customer support , i have no idea how the product is , but the customer support is just horrible . go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the " post your own thoughts " page through member accounts , you 'll see that i 'm not alone in this issue . i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare . i did not have one problem with these installs . please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system ( seperate from onecare ) . this costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare	5
the video-editing component of this package , video wave , worked great for me for about a year , but it has recently turned into a nightmare ! the audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video , and after trying everything i 'm convinced that its a problem with the code . a quick product search will show others who have had similar problems . i would stay away	5
it does n't really smell like anything , and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on . but it is a good size and shape	3
i 've used omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf . nothing really fancy , two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables . using this software was a nightmare . the ocr worked better than the previous version but it showed mixed fonts on the page ( two column text w a title about 1 / 3 down and above the text ) . no problem i thought , i 'll just use the wysiwyg ( what you see if what you get ) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features . well , wysiyg is more like wysiwydon'tget . i 'd fix the fonts , save the file , open it in adobe reader and find that omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts / size and the titles . i tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines ( each w text followed by a page number ) ...no go . plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into ' replace text ' mode while i was trying to insert text and i could n't get out . in frustration i used a friends machine w abby finereader 7.0 pro...what a welcome change . ocr was at least as fast and accurate and the editor , while not as feature laden as omnipages , actually worked ! i did in 6 hrs what i 'd been trying for well over 12 to do in omnipage..and that was w / o going thru any of the tutorial info..just loaded it and started . i 'm buying abby for my next project , they 've upgraded to 8.0 and i 'll bet it 's editor delivers what omnipage only promises . i would n't recommend omnipage 15 pro to anyone	5
i have tried everything . firewire , usb . there was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your pc then to your camera , then turn on the pc then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order . if you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged . what kind of a crazy world does panasonic live in ? well , i followed the instructions to the tee , downloded the right drivers and all and yet my pc does not recognize the gs19 or the gs9. i have used both . the gs19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back . i thought , this model would have gone away with the kinks but , no ! so , my panasonic recorded dvs are gonna remain on the tape . i will never be able to put them on dvds . what a joke , this camera turned out to be	1
without a doubt , the highlight is the dvd of the 1975 show in london . " born to run , " the album , had put him on the cover of " time " and " newsweek " the same week in october , 1975 , one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story . the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash : " nobody can be that good . " so here we see his first show ever in the uk , playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics , people thinking , " hey , ' rock and roll future , ' this is the land of the beatles , the rolling stones , the who - who do you think you 're kidding . no unknown kid from america deserves ' time ' and ' newsweek . ' " the show begins in almost total darkness , a piano softly plays , then harmonica , and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings " thunder road , " accompanied by only piano . an unknown song at the time , " thunder road " has become a springsteen classic . imho , especially given the expectations , it is a perfect understated opening . the dvd has the entire show , including everything from the hard rock of " she 's the one , " and " born to run , " the song , to a much slowed down version of " for you , " an underated sleeper on his first album , " greeting from asbuty park , nj . " bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear , this version of " for you " is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god . any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears , no taste , or was xenophobic . the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real , as a songwriter and performer , and that " born to run , " especially , is an extraodinary album . there are only eight songs , but none are fill . repeated listenings of the four corners of the album ( before cds ) " backstreets , " " jungleland , " thunder road , " and the title song are so good they become.. . well , addictive , works of genius , and lead to still more listening . " tenth avenue freeze out , " " night , " and especially " she 's the one " could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album . even the whispered " meeting across the river , " fits and helps the album become a coherent whole . the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts . as a footnote i 'll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as " born to run " and that is his next one , " darkness on the edge of town . " everything he has released is good ; a good bit of it is great , but i do n't think anything else matches " born to run " or " darkness . " i do n't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released . the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock 's greatest performer . by 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world , selling out multiple nights at football stadiums . the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears . perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement . the dvd , " the making of ' born to run , ' " is interesting , but will probably appeal mainly to fans . however the dvd of the 1975 london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce , or rock & roll , or showmanship , or history . its a treat	4
sidney bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz . burns puts together a great combination of early recordings . jazz historions note bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with louis armstrong . you have to include bechet in your jazz collection , and this one is as good as any	4

millionaire fredrick loren played by a young vincent price invites five strangers to a party in the house on haunted hill . with his delectable wife annabel in tow , he has set the strangers a task of sorts , if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10 , 000 each , however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer , the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted . one of the guests in the house was even related to one of the victims and he is emphatic that the whole house is haunted and that they are all doomed because of what they are doing . at midnight the door is locked and everyone in the house waits to see what will happen next , and very soon all are locked into a game of terror and murder as the house on haunted hill takes on a life of its own , but there is a twist in the tale that is deliciously surprising as it is fun . i enjoyed this film , it was n't overly suspenseful , but there are enough scenes to make you jump every now and then , the special effects were none-existent and there was a lot of screaming and shrieking from the character norah a young woman who appears to be being targeted by the ghosts in the house . all in all a hokum of a movie but great fun all the same .	2
i ordered this and , while i 'm a fan of other therabeads products , i found this poorly designed . unless you have a very thick neck , the velcro straps are worse than useless . they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover . the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck - - and then it did n't cover the neck well .	3
i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely . the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the a6xx series . my adapter arrived and it does n't work with my camera . kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately . bummer . also , captain jack is correct about the vignetting . this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens . if you zoom wide angle , you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned . if you stay zoomed in , it works ok . disappointing	1
i deinstall the product after two weeks of use . it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents . if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing . also , the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often non-functional	5
in wandering around the web , i find i am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing ( from photoshop elements 5 ) . when importing , lightroom " thinks " for a long time ( that 's fine , and they do warn you it can be slow ) , but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import . about the rest of the program ? i do n't know . too frustrated just trying to get it up and running .	5
i had a chance to compare it with a tokina glass . canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion , same or even slightly worse on a sharpness , and complete looser on a build quality . if you are ok with 12mm - get tokina	1
as you can see by other reviews above , the studio series has a history of being buggy . you also hear a lot of people saying " this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other ' powerful enough to be worth owning ' packages - - if only it were more stable ! " i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back to version 9 ) , and finally with version 10.6 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i 'd hoped when i bought it . the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n't clarify . and i 'm a very sophisticated computer user by most measures . i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd 's into dvd's . i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download . one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every " project " you work on in a separate subdirectory . if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 , / game2 etc. series of subfolders . if you edit those to a " jimmy 's great plays " proect , put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder . when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5. i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , and i do n't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why did i stick with something where i admit that version 9.0 was " powerful but unstable " and 10.0 was " more powerful and more unstable " ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions , and when i use it things turn out as i expect . now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer . so that 's how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review . i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions , but that " 10.5 updated for free to 10.6 " really is the best choice out there now.. . as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !	5
i paid top dollar for ps7 and thought it was time to upgrade to cs2. after i installed cs2 i discovered that i could not crop any photo without having my pc crash . every time it crashed i looked at the defrag utility and i had fragmented files all over the place . then i defraged the hard drive and went back to cs2 and tried to crop the same photo again . again , my pc hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said i had to defrag . the only thing i did was to crop one photo in cs2 , and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again . i uninstalled this piece of garbage from my pc . it does not work , and i do n't care what deke mcclelland says and i do n't believe what he says , either . save your money . these rip-off artists at adobe are nothing but thieves . yeah , they ripped me off for $153 but you know what ? at least i have my integrity , and that 's more than you got , deke baby .	5

office 97 was a pretty good product . the programs were powerful , had a decent interface ( maybe not as good as the claris products of the early 1990s , but not bad ) , and came with a ton of features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word- -anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988. another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997. apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them- -such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier	5
5 stars to the film itself ! here 's a painful study of a woman 's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate , uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste . the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski 's repulsion but dwells on vitti 's being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve 's intensive plunge to schizophrenia . the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director 's works . one of his greatest works ( l'avventura remains his best to me ) . the only problem is the dvd transfer . i 've seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange . the dvd , although sharper and clearer , fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots . for a film that essentially deals with color ( it was antonioni 's first color feature ) , the transfer was rather clumsy and careless . the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement . why did n't criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	2
you got to have extremely steady hand , or camera stand to use this camaera . during my niece wedding , i put in a 2gb of memory and we were trigger happy , we must have took over couple hundred of pictures , however , i am very unhappy about the result . 3 out of 5 pictures are fuzzy , messy , out of focus . on the other hand , for the pictures that took a few mins to line up and with a very very steady hand , you got a great picture . size is good , weight is a bit on the heavy side for the size , but to some people that 's good quality	1
this oregon scientific pedometer is very inaccurate and a waste of money even at the cheap price . there is no point to even considering " saving money " when it comes to pedometers if the count is going to be almost arbitrary	3
tis is the best joint supplement i have found on the market . thank you amazon for carrying it	3
if you liked whyte 's previous sophomoric efforts , you 'll love this . in addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler : in no real way does the story get advanced . arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy . there are adventures , but nothing important happens . as usual , in whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters . with all the ( totally ahistorical ) democratic rhetoric , merlin 's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot . anyone who would read this , i guess , has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and does n't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence , caricatures who never grow or change , and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship . so go for it . but please , if you want something exciting that will also make you think , look at the really good arthurian efforts out there- -gillian brandshaw , a.a. attanasio , or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few. .	0
the movie is a about a guy , who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that . that 's pretty much the whole story . well , the idea is quite powerful but not new , the characters are done in the " comics " style and very primitive , the jokes are quite boring . actually what is really amazing , that it could 've been ok to watch as a family movie , but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun , so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids . too boring for adults , not appropriate for kids , too much moral for young crowd - i ca n't really think who might like it	2
two months . . .the amount of time in which i saved to purchase what i thought was an 8 megapixel camera for a steal . . . one week . . .to find that no matter what i tried i was utterly dissapointed . . . 1 ) no matter the setting every picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than i horrible blur . 2 ) the 5 minute 2 time flash is horrible . . .every person i try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in 90% horrible family photos . i could go on but i wont . . .i cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money . . .there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon . . .because it is not worth it . i now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera	1
im a huge fan of writer sean mcginly , his classics include venomous starring treat williams and sonic impact with ice-t . mcginly 's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world , he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film two days . i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast ( which included hacks like paul rudd ) was not in the same league as superstars traci bingham and ice-t who have graced some of his previous work . please sean , stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff , leave that to idiots like capra , wenders , scorcese etc. they are not in your league .	2
there are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w / specific components of the toshiba satellite m45-s355. the hardware incompatibility issues w / the dvd-ram drive , the gl910 chipset , and the soundmax integrated audio drivers are known to both microsoft technical service personnel and their counterparts at toshiba . i spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies ( both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as " english " ) . the amazon representative with whom i spoke was in new delhi . i ultimately figured out ( on my own ) which toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded ( again consuming hours of download time with a 56k modem ) , and i used an iomega cd-rom usb external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours . i was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install small business accounting 2006. do n't buy these products unless you absolutely must . microsoft 's " technical service " is a euphemism more aptly meaning " technically useless " . there is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of microsoft xp professional . i should also mention that both the toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from amazon	5
you know the feeling...that feeling of " oh my gosh , how did i ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end ? " well , that 's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film . unfortunately , because of its all-star cast , although this would n't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted . aside from an interesting peek into the world of yale 's secret skull and bones society , a delightful cameo by joe pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers , this movie has little or nothing to offer . it does n't keep one 's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on , you realize that you do n't even care about the characters . matt damon 's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry , especially with the beautiful angelina jolie , and he is laughably miscast as a father . in fairness however , with the script he 's been given , it 's hard to see how damon could have done much better . the pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends . a huge disappoinment especially since director deniro is such a talented actor . skip it	2
this was the best item i ever bought for my camera . i do a lot of walking with my camera , and thought i would use it as a walking stick , which i do , but the best part of this monopod is what i never thought would happen . my pictures are never fuzzy ! i can take low light photos and have they come out clear . i paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera . the three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths . the carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
i enjoyed this book having read other non-fiction frontier books . however , i must say that the degree to which the author delves into how to make certain tools / objects , etc. , i could have done without . i would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker , because such descriptions were so detailed . if you 're a technical / hands-on person , then you probably would like knowing how items / tools were built from raw materials in the frontier . but for me , i was more interested in the story , than the instructionals .	0
turbotax was a great service , but i would like to be able to navigate with menus / tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself . writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered . to get to a particular prior page , i would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages , reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice . this was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product . it could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1 ) switched the defaults to the users ' previously-inputted values ( completetax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do ) and / or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link . this is what a good web-page does , and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same .	5
very seldom do i give up on a book ; i gave up on this one after several attempts to finish . i have read barbara delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books . i remember the fascination with the peyton place / grace metalious hoopla in the 50 's and 60 's so i was expecting to enjoy this story . it is dull and tiresome .	0
was surprised by the price compared to other movies , but it was worth it	2
i was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free . the manufacturer computer associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too . as for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl . after a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed	5
gerry beckley is " timeless " . his new cd is awesome and seems to go back to his roots . his songs over the years last lifetimes and bring back amazing memories.this new cd just proves he hasnt lost his touch . anyone who does not agree , doesnt know the real gerry . i have had the privilege to meet him and talk with him many times , including being able to celebrate new years eve with them after a concert with the rest of america and their families.he is one of the nicest people i have ever met , and his songs have always been a part of my life . i hope there are still many more cd 's still to come and look forward to seeing him again in the near future in concert and afterwards	4
this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money . our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair . and that brings around another problem - - emjoi customer service and repair service . you 'll want to avoid both . better yet , avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache . not only are emjoi products cheap , they are painful to use	3
i am a huge atl fan . black mafia 4 life , know what i mean . i waited a long time for this release , and it was painful to listen to . it just seemed to lack direction . it might be said that this album ( an independent record label ) was so bad , that it ended their careers . too bad , i loved atl .	4
this might be the best cd that has come out this year . it may be will oldham 's best cd since " viva last blues . " it may be better than " viva last blues " although these are two different styled cds . " the letting go " has a mostly very mellow sound . almost every song is beautiful . the string and guitar melodies are uplifting . will oldham 's voice is grounding , it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so . dawn mccarthy 's voice will then again lift you up . mccarthy 's voice is a fantastic companion to oldham's . other singers / bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating . this is not the case with " the letting go , " mccarthy 's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from oldham . i have n't listened to a will oldham album since " ease down the road . " this makes me want to go back and listen to those albums i have missed . one song in particular , " the seedling " ( i believe ) has a different sound than the rest of the album . it has a harsher sound , but is still a good song . this is a great introduction if you are new to oldham or if you are returning listener .	4

this a " mystery-triller " starring tom berenger , gretta scacchi , corbin bernsen , joanne whalley-kilmer and bob hoskins , it 's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive.she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically , crashing all the way.she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm , while he amazingly lives , at first leaving him in a coma , but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger.he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia.later , after being nursed back to health and " falling in love with his wife all over again , " he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man.obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth . it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller , but comes predictable fast.i knew the key ' mysteries ' almost immediately and i 'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law & order episodes will agree.eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments.i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again	2
we have it hanging in a closet and it has been working great ! when it changes color all i do is plug it in for about 10-12 hours and then hang it back up again ! we are very satisfied	3
i am in the planning stages of a new business venture . i have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself . this book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author 's friends have used them . it is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan , and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends . the most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created . he entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks . hello ! ! ! mcfly ! ! ! did n't i just buy your book so that i could learn your marketing insights ? yes ! so then why do you make it seem like i just paid for the teaser information , and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career ? my price of admission stops at the price of this book , and it should not seem like i 'm only getting half of the story that i paid for !	0
outstanding camera in every respect . i 've owned several digital cameras in recent years ( sony & nikon ) . the n2 's giant 3 " lcd , the touch screen features , lens optics , and overall ease of use top any of my previous cameras . i use it for both land and underwater photography and it performs flawlessly . good job sony	1
i found this product to be very unique , and helpful , in that i could quickly remove & retain the glasses around my neck . being far-sighted , i have come to need reading glasses , and these are perfect for my needs . i can look ' down ' through them , and look ' over the frame ' for distance , all while they are secured around my head and neck . i do hiking , using a gps device , and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand , while also looking forward towards my path of travel . thank you for the innovative product	3
excellent service , and the product worked extremely well . the only criticism i would have is the cost of postage . it was ridiculous , the product came in a big parcel , and inside was a dvd .	5
while not every song my be my favorite , they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days ! all the monster cds i have bought have been real gems .	4
i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography , it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends . i have used the older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions . the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me ; less to break . the c530 is more compact , has better resolution , and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you will love this little camera	1
i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels . this was my first sw novel . i must say i want to be a sith . i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming . if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth ! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects . i however got more excited because i played kotor / ep3 the game / kotor 2 and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games . i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in ep3. it an amazing story and ca n't wait to a sequel if any .	0
i did n't expect to " like " this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages . the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go . and , more importantly , why would i want to read it ! where does the story go ? it 's a wandering timetable . we know the two main characters , joseph and celice , both professors of zoology married for 30 years , are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay , but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter , syl , as she copes with her knowledge of their death . it also goes back to when they first met , as students sharing a study house at the shore . they are an unlikely pair , and yet , they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience , and live- -at least according to their estranged daughter- -an unremarkable life . the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives , hour by hour , from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they 'd met some 30 years earlier . the layout of the story was brilliant , and not in the least bit confusing . the language ( british english ) is both lofty and gritty- -probably not unlike joseph and celice . some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very , very poignant . for example , when syl contemplates the loss of her parents : " ... her gene supplies had closed shop . their daughter was the next in line . she could not duck out of the queue . so she should not waste her time in this black universe . the world 's small , breathing denizens , its quaking congregations and its stargazers , were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell . no one transcends . there is no future and no past . there is no remedy for death- -or birth- -except to hug the spaces in between . live loud . live wide . live tall . " i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on , and the importance of our obligation to the dead ( and dying ) that we live life well . the title and thesis of the book are one and the same : " being dead . " highly recommend . from the author of " a line between friends , " mckenna publishing group	0
this was almost too strong for me at first . i put it on the lower level of the house and it took away that " basement " smell for months . i was impressed with the " throw " this thing had . i would definitely repurchase .	3
growing up with classical rock and having enjoyed rock music by rod stewart , i did n't think i 'd like this cd . one evening i was having dinner at a friend 's home and they had this one playing . it was beautiful . being a little older now ( in my early 40 's ) , i enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now . this cd of rod 's was nostalgic , romantic and extremely easy to listen to .	4
man , oh man , i think this is one of the worst books i 've ever read . if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars , i would ! seriously , half way through , i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was . boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive ! i found the book bizarre , unfocused and poorly written . the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused . the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation . the physics , engineering , psychology , medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic . characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome , only to have them dissipate . and so on . the characters do n't even seem like real people . for example , the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain , and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are . how could someone know a person that well , but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood ? or : one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them . c'mon , if the guys a nut ( and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking ' duck ' to them is nuts ! ) , write him as a nut the whole way through , do n't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book 's climax ! the book 's title is n't even explained , for crying out loud . thanatos means death in greek , i believe , but i could never understand what the author / editors / audience thought was dying . i wo n't read this one again , nor will i look for anything else by percy walker .	0

we used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently . as a previous reviewer stated , sometimes it works , sometimes not , so i combined it with the recommended dosage for infant gas drops and that would do the trick . i found little tummy 's brand at babies-r-us , which is less expensive and is the same thing . later , after 6 months and trying new foods , there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something did n't agree with her . i gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she 'd clearly feel better	3
only way you are gonna like this music is if you are some depressed emo kid who listens to punk rock music just because it is punk , and you think that 'll make you cool . this cd just does n't display musical talent , maybe originality , but this is not high quality music	4
i purchased these but had to return them . while the molded strap is adjustable , it only opens up approx . 1 " . the magnetic attachment worked well but if your head is 23.5 " or larger around - at the eyebrows , forget it , these will not fit you	3
i caught sonny in a live performance this past november , so i got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album...sonny please . he opened the set with a fiery " sonny please " which smoked for a good 15 minutes ( i believe that victor lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving ) . for a man approaching 77 years of age , i was impressed with not only sonny 's playing and gracious presence , but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets...trust me , the man can still play ! this album may not be another " saxophone colossus " or " the bridge " , but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of sonny 's fans . if you have no recorded music by this jazz legend , this cd is a respectable starting point	4
the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives . i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948. i am not questioning mosley 's portrayal of racism . however , i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948 , and the answer is not very . there may have been poverty , racism , alcholism , but l.a. county seemed pretty safe ; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find , 1827 ! mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way . throw in speakeasies , gangsters hijacking liquor trucks , and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928. i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate . but many , many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life / era / place that had not been shown before . from what i can tell , he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s ( i guess those years average to be about 1948 ) . mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation . however , i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic , and i hope readers realize that it is not . easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak , but unfortunately large , group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting . a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect ; that is interesting to read . detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via confession . easy does solve one of the murders on his own , but just about everything he " solves " is simply confessed to him . i find that extremely dissatisfying . mosley has packed the book with violence , but seems to know very little about violence himself . none of the fights are well described . easy , for being a self-professed " killing machine " ca n't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them . they are either big or they are small . he does not come of as being hard-boiled , but rather a pathetic braggart mosley does show signs of being a very good writer . but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional . i imagine that his work must have improved , but this effort is nothing to get exceited over . and again , i do n't obsess over accuracy , but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel .	0
i was very disappointed with this show . having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd , now i feel cheated . the jokes are weak , his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off-the-mark african accent were more annoying than amusing . jamie was crude , disgusting and even more disappointingly , not funny at all . he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it was n't his best performance . he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly . i do not recommend this dvd at all	2
if you liked the original clerks soundtrack , then you 're sure to love this . thirteen years after we heard randall and dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first clerks soundtrack , now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is , in fact , the real trilogy . and we , the clerks fans , get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track . oh , and did i mention the music ? terrific ! kevin smith 's choices are so fitting for each scene in the movie . it 's not too difficult to imagine that kevin has been thinking about these track choices for a long time . in typical kevin smith fashion , the usual array of artists are included as well as some cool surprises . you 've got your typical soul asylum and alanis morrisette as well as king diamond and an unexpected jackson 5 dance number . if you have not seen the movie , please make sure to do so before purchasing the soundtrack . doing so is sure to give the songs so much more meaning as you listen to them . overall , a really good soundtrack compilation that is sure to please any clerks fan .	4
the fisrt cd is alot better than this one , but this one is still okay . i only liked one song on this disc and it is . track 4. will the circle be unbroken / i 'll fly away / jesus loves me . do n't get me wrong the music is beautiful , but i think the first one is alot better	4
again , another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when hollywood gives to him a free hand ( or not so much ) things go wrong . is not funny , wilson and stiller are n't interesting enough and the 70 's is n't a good decade to crave for . with this kind of films , is useful to listen to american critics , they know more about their own culture than us	2
the noise problem with this camera is horrendous . do not buy it ! if you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly.. . never . no matter how hard you try . my 3-year old 5mpx sony is much better than this panasonic camera . i am sorry i bought it . i would return this product if i could and buy a good camera instead . the lumix dmc-lx2 camera cannot focus one bit , many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem . even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred . noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily . you can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness , noise reduction , contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem . the amazon website says you can use standard sd memory which is untrue ( perhaps this has been corrected now ) . the camera only accepts more expensive sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . these sdhc cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so i have to use the usb port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer .	1
this product is simply phenomenal . i 've seen better results using this than with department store brands	3
this kit is a must have for any of the compatible canon cameras . digital camera rule #1 : always carry a spare battery - the kit is almost worth it for that alone . the leather case is great : stylish looks that provides a tough protective armor in case you drop the camera . the neck strap is quite strong and looks good too . it may not be everyone 's cup of tea but i like it . it comes in handy when i need quick access to the camera and do n't want to fumble through pockets or bags	1
i 've had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week . it was on tv here . otherwise , i do n't think i would have watched it . my instincts would have been correct . an action technothriller , stealth has a predictable plot . a new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field : an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots , including a disrespect for authority . mayhem ensues . people die . the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence , and they work together to save the female pilot , who 's gone down in north korea . the plot , direction , and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads ( josh lucas , jessica biel , jamie foxx ) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart . i 'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads , and came away disappointed . me ? i was expecting little , so i guess my expectations were met . though i will say i was amused by the last line	2
i 'd give this product zero stars if i could . i use the quickbooks online payment service with version 2004 , and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service , so they forced me to upgrade . so i bought the upgrade , and when i ran the installer it would n't accept my serial number . i spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to india , and he still could n't get it to work . i finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer . i had heard from others , including an accountant , that this version was bad but could n't believe it would really be this bad . i 'd used qb since the early-1990s and never really had a problem . but this is really , really bad . intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version . it 's a total lemon	5
this ancient jazz classic never sounded better.rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24 - bit.he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic . just keep them coming rudy	4
does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures ! after buying this book - i was very disappointed since i thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks , rather it just shows displays of women 's faces . you will waste your money on purchasing this book	0
omgosh i cannot tell you how much i love this straightener . it makes my hair so soft its like baby bottom soft or when u sand wood for a really really long time . i love it . i use it everymorning. . at night i use the wet setting to dry off my hair and then in the mroning i finish it off with the dry settting . but i also use sunsilk pink bottle 24 / 7 creme . its an absolute must-have . to the person who gave it one star. . maybe yours was a defect . im sure everyone else who has rated it so far loved it . did you straighten it section by section ? it doesnt work if you do it all at once . i recommend this straightener ! its not that expensive and also makes a great christmas gift . looks nice too . enjoy	3
i 've had my d2h for 9 months now . i 've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it..skin tones on my unit are great . it seems this issue plagued a minority of users . camera is very fast , exposes well and delivers results . it 's primarily designed to be a sports and photojournalism camera - - for situations where speed counts . it 's a 4 megapixel wonder - - it 's true it only has 4 megapixels , but they are 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup , or wait for the d2x . the price of the d2x is making that decision a bit easier and i 'm leaning toward another d2h .	1
having had perfectly clear skin through my teens , 20s , and most of my 30s , i now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. my skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most otc acne products . i bought this product out of desperation , not believing it would work . after reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks , i have found that it works well , with some modifications . my experience : cystic acne goes through its normal cycle ( rising to surface , becoming a hideous scab , etc. ) in a fraction of the normal time ( 4 days versus 4 weeks ) when treated as directed with zeno , or it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface ( after a week or so ) , when treated very aggressively with zeno . my advice : do n't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised . do know that with diligence and patience , it will work . be very aggressive . do double-cycles ( allow the zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks	3
i was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie . i could n't get past the first 15 minutes.. . incoherent beginning , and overly stylized particularly where ashe becomes " the avenger " ( for lack of a better name ) . nothing like the original at all , which i love by comparison	2
there are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w / specific components of the toshiba satellite m45-s355. the hardware incompatibility issues w / the dvd-ram drive , the gl910 chipset , and the soundmax integrated audio drivers are known to both microsoft technical service personnel and their counterparts at toshiba . i spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies ( both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as " english " ) . the amazon representative with whom i spoke was in new delhi . i ultimately figured out ( on my own ) which toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded ( again consuming hours of download time with a 56k modem ) , and i used an iomega cd-rom usb external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours . i was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install small business accounting 2006. do n't buy these products unless you absolutely must . microsoft 's " technical service " is a euphemism more aptly meaning " technically useless " . there is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of microsoft xp professional . i should also mention that both the toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from amazon	5

the clean kick-started the illustrious new zealand label flying nun in 1981 , providing a key blueprint for indie-rockers from australia ( the chills ) to california ( pavement ) . over this two-disc , 46-track set of rarities and essentials , the trio takes the chugga-chugga racket of the velvet underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited , rudimentary playing , shaky , kiwi-accented vocals and endearing melodies . disc one , as influential for the lo-fi sonics as for the songs , ends with the clean 's 1983 breakup . disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996 's unknown country , mining similar material with even more exciting ( and even better-sounding ) results . but by then , lots of bands were doing what the mighty clean had helped pioneer .	4
obviously bogus reviews . version 6 was slow as a dog , so any improvement will make this more interesting . of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting . what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 ? how bout tossing us all a bone	5
apparently the difference between a criminal act ( theft ) and moral redistribution of income is 1 ) who you steal from ( stealing from the wealthy , of course , is moral - - according to rawls and bolsheviks ) , and 2 ) who receives the loot ( the non-wealthy makes it moral ) , and 3 ) who commits the act ( the state / society , of course also makes theft moral ; example - taxation ) , and 4 ) your intentions ( redistribution of income ) . to look at this another way , if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money , that 's a crime ( unless your neighbor is poor - - which would then be moral and justice , according to rawls ' formula ) . if the community comes into your house and steals from you , it 's legal and moral justice , again , according to rawls . because , according to rawls , if , before you were born , you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured , you 'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal , or they would be compensated somehow for being born ( unjustly ) less-equal . how ? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more . so those with more would be like oh , say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less . so those with more would become a resource , or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because " society " ( the robin hoods and rawls of the world ) deemed this as moral justice . rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk , entrepreneurs , students of life who work to earn an " a " vs. students who earn an " f " . he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own . true . but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause , nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference . forcing the " wealthier " ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill is n't justice or moral . it would simply be an unjust law . some people see rawls ' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia ( like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism ) . i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery , and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit . in a sense , this book is an argument against the individual . it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people - - he does n't recognize any individuals ( unless they were born as victims ) . curious . how do you experience life ... as a group-mind ( an oxymoron if there ever was one ) , a collective ? or as a unique , isolated , independent , individual ? there should be societal incentives to help each other . okay . but when it is forced ( theft of property always implies force ) , it is no longer an issue of morality or justice - - it 's simply a law . without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue , by definition . transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom ?	0

as the editor of the learning spanish products reviews ( learningspanishproductsreviews ) site , one of my responsibilities is to review learning-spanish software products that are listed on amazon . i am also a native spanish speaker and a professional spanish instructor . rosetta stone spanish is a great learning spanish product for a child or pre-teenager that wants to learn spanish . this software features native speakers , real-life images , and a speech recognition feature . your child or pre-teenager will find that this software is lots of fun . but the photographs do appear to be from at least two decades ago . i 'd actually give this product 5 stars as a tool for teaching a child or pre-teenager spanish . but as a learning-spanish product for an adult the effectiveness of the product really depends on whether the adult is a visual learner or not . my advice is for you to also experiment with some of the auditory or auditory / text based comprehensive spanish courses sold on amazon , and decide if you are primarily a visual or auditory ( or auditory / text ) learner . even if you determine that you learn better with or an auditory spanish course you can still get good results with rosetta stone spanish , by using it to complement your main auditory home-study spanish course . you may also find the rosetta stone software helpful if you 're an adult that has one or more of the major comprehensive auditory courses under your belt , and now you are merely seeking to expand your vocabulary .	5

i am a retired senior software engineer ( web development ) . i 've used many antivirus / malware packages both at work and at home . this is the absolute worst . after installing it , i got popup virus alerts from bitdefender every 10 seconds . no kidding . i could n't believe it . i previously had a copy of norton antivirus 5 on my computer which is highly reliable ( not like the latest version ) . i tried bitdefender based on the reviews below which were obviously written by people with less than standard operating systems . i use a pc with windows xp sp2 and ie6 ( ie7 is still buggy ) . although multiple runs of bitdefender show absolutely no viruses or malware on my system , i continue to get these popup " virus alerts " every 10 seconds when i browse the internet , which is way more irritating than anything norton ever did to my computer . in addition , it drags my computer to almost a screeching halt when i go to a web page i have n't been to in more than a day , sometimes even the ones i just went to an hour ago . i find this truly irritating and went to bitdefender 's website and tried their online chat . " jack " was completely worthless . he told me to completely wipe out my cookies , as well as a lot of other useful files for no apparent reason other than he 's probably not named jack , but something like vishnu and this was the first thing on a long list of things to tell people to do . very useless . not recommended for anyone . try to get an old copy of norton antivirus 5 and pay for the update feature ( $20 per year ) . much better than this garbage . in addition , there are virtually no options to customizing this product . you 're stuck with what they think is necessary ( like automatically deleting internet files you may need- -like shopping carts ) . it literally cripples your computer .	5

i wrote a review but i guess it was so bad for ultramagnetic , amazon booted it . the album is trash . nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago . but do n't take my word for it , sample for yourself . ahead of their time ? faith no more . what can i say about this album without my review getting kicked off amazon again ? i 've used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does . 1988 's critical beatdown never , ever gave that kind of deliverance . that 's why that 's a classic and the best kept secret is not , by any means ( vocally , production , lyrically , concept ) . can i get a witness ? please ? dj moe luv is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old ultramagnetic sound alive here on " vibrato " and " mechanism nice ( born twice ) " the album 's 1st single . ced-gee kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of 16 bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene ( never heard that on critical beatdown by ced ) . kool keith does fine on solo track " late nite rumble " but kool keith is goin ' nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs , his delivery is sounding just like ced 's towards the end of the album . t.r. love ? m.i.a. you see him in photos , you hear silence from him , he does n't even produce a track . production by ced , moe and 2 others and the other 2 sound like kutmasta kurt producing ( producer for most of kool keith solo stuff ) . i do not mean that in a good way . the beats of " nottz " is bangin ' , the lyrics by both keith and ced should raise eyebrows on what 's next to come for the best kept secret being the b-side to the 1st single " mechanism nice ( born twice ) " . songs like " ai n't it good 2 u " ( 2007 ) and " party started " are for gentleman 's clubs for the girls to dance to . now do you see what direction this album is goin ' ? if you 're lookin ' for ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and / or the masterful , brainiac , monkey wrench lyricism as critical beatdown ; funk your head up and the four horsemen albums gave you over a decade ago , you will not find it here . maybe in the next 14 years . right ultramag	4
the star trek collection is a worthy hobby and certainly the largest of the television series dvd collections ( the original series , the next generation , deep space nine , voyager and enterprise ) . at around 1100 minutes per box ( a few hours less than the tos seasons ) we are still looking at approx 30 boxes with 700 hours of viewing . that is 1 month of non-stop star trek . no dvd series comes remotely close to that . get going collecting right now and build up on each succession over the years . by the end you will have a very serious anthology that defines the word awe . this is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time for the next few years . it is a cherished memory that served your fathers and will serve your children also . our very planet , earth , has advanced because of gene roddenberry 's admirable concept . roddenberry nailed the premise of the series when he said that he wanted to create a show with characters that we could look up too . ` the bridge ' members are like our family . watch what they do . then go and spend your life striving for the same on earth . what engineer , medic , scientist , teacher , worker can not say that star trek has not influenced them ? the show is this significant in the development of our species . even christians respect and quote its authority and it is not hard to see why . the dvd case is not quite as fancy as the tos ( the original series ) cases . the tng case is supposed to resemble a tng crew briefcase . the case opens to reveal the disc booklet inside a sleeve . sliding the disc booklet out of the sleeve and flipping it open reveals a spread of 7 discs . there are 4 episodes per disc . however the last disc , disc 7 , only has two episodes , for a grand total of 26 episodes ( tos has 8 discs , 30 episodes ) . the rest of disc 7 is devoted to star trek interviews and trailers with the usual expected extras...and then some more . the episodes are ordered not in the sequence they where filmed , but in the sequence that they aired , however each episode has been numbered according to the order they where filmed in . this means on one disc you have shows 4 , 2 , 12 and 1 , in that order . the sound has also been remastered to 5:1 dolby digital ! since the show was shot in full frame , these dimensions are retained . star trek , the next generation ( tng ) , season one , had an amazing impact when it was first broadcast . an instant hit and a milestone in television serials ( it ran for 7 seasons unlike its predecessor that ran for 3 ) , its characters and new look enterprise had us glued to the tv with the first computer generated images of our solar system as captain picard utters the immortal words.. . ` to baldly' ... i mean.. . ` to boldly go where no man' ... i mean.. . ` to boldly go where no one has gone before . ' viewing the episodes in the order they where filmed does not show a vision in the shaping as per the tos series but is more of the same again ( even remaking some tos episodes ) , this time with more characters , more action and more special effects . season 1 all of the main characters in the tng series are in episode one , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker , lieutenant / lt. commander geordi la forge , lieutenant tasha yar , lieutenant worf , commander dr. beverly crusher , lt. commander / commander deanna troi , lt. commander data and ensign wesley crusher . only natasha yar quits before the first season is finished . commander dr. beverly crusher is replaced by doctor katherine pulaski for season two . ensign wesley crusher is only sometimes reoccurring after season four . the enterprise itself is beautifully rendered with additional areas such as the holodeck allowing for almost any environment at the users choosing , playing an important function in many episodes . the use of computer generated images ( a ground-breaking television experience back in 1987 ! ) allowed for inspirational subspace sequences , planets , backdrops , an improved bridge main viewer and windows ! advances in makeup effects brought new alien characters to life and allowed an actor to appear as if he where indeed an android . tng season one attempts to relate with tos by reviving similar stories while at the same time adding on additional insights into new and fascinating sci-fi theory while retaining most of the character arcs that made tos so interesting . the stories ( also written by tos 's dc fontana ) are as fresh today as they where in the late 80s , early 90s , when tng first aired . season one of tng is mostly about deities , infections , alien cultures , galactic politics , time travel , alien forces , mind control , family matters , computer malfunctions and starfleet academy . there are also the unforgettable episodes ` encounter at farpoint ' which introduces us to the crew of the enterprise and the mysterious q , ` where no one has gone before ' a wonderful story about travelling the cosmos , ` datalore ' which features two data characters , ` heart of glory ' with some in-depth revelations about klingons , ` skin of evil ' featuring some remarkable effects for its time with a very sad ending , and the classic ` conspiracy ' ( this episode is uncut , which features some violent scenes involving a head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious] ) about an invasion of the body snatchers type takeover of starfleet . the bottom line for tng : season one is that it will bring back some enormously delightful memories for those who where awe inspired by it when it first came out . although we can debate about which is the better series , tng or tos , we still absolutely adore both . we might miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but hearing picard saying ` make it so ' just makes our day . season 2 season two , still carries on with repeating much of the stories in tos , revamping them and then adding some new stuff of its own , boosting data 's screen time , bumping up the computer generated graphics to allow for things like shuttlecraft launching and manoeuvres , improved alien cgi and an enhancement in particle effects . they even attempt a type of morphing . most of the main characters from season one are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker ( now with a beard ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow ) , commander deanna troi ( complete with low-cut red starfleet costume ) , lt. commander data and ensign wesley crusher . however obviously commander lieutenant tasha yar is gone but so is dr. beverly crusher ( who was not bad-looking ) , replaced by doctor katherine pulaski ( who looks like your granny ! ) for season two because dr. crusher has been reassigned to starfleet medical as explained in episode one of season three ( in reality the tng writers where having difficulties in developing crusher 's character , would later reinstate her for season three , dropping pulaski because they felt her character was not working ) . colm meaney as miles edward o'brien , navigation from season one gets more screentime , while the new whoopi goldberg chatacter , guinan , is the wise el aurian bartender in 10 forward , the new bar room where the enterprise crew get to relax . except for this extra area the enterprise itself has not gone undergone much of a revamp and this season is far more enterprise based than season one , or all of tos , meaning season two has less planetary exploration stories which is a bit of a drawback , but sets a new standards in the ` hotel in space ' feel that would produce the ` deep space nine ' series . season two of tng is mostly about alien impregnation , mystery space , ai , the holodeck , interplanetary relations , rapid aging , justice , shape-shifting , time travel , family , the prime directive , kidnapping , cloning , war games and infections . the big plus side to not having that much planetary exploration is that there are lots of stories with klingons and the first encounter with the borg ! the unforgettable episodes are , ` elementary , dear data ' where data takes on his sherlock holmes persona and we are introduced to the moriarty character . ` loud as a whisper ' is about a deaf and dumb peace negotiator . ` a matter of honor ' is where riker serves on a klingon battleship . ` q who ? ' may well be the best episode here because it is the first time we meet the borg . the last episode of season two ` shades of gray ' may be one of the worst star trek episodes ever , which uses riker 's memories from seasons one and two to make up an entire episode and even includes the uncut scenes for the season one episode ` conspiracy ' featuring the violent head explosion edited from some daytime television showings [so parents be cautious again] ) . the bottom line for tng : season two is that for all it shortcomings because of lack of beaming down , we get the borg and lots and lots of klingons . at this stage in the saga we might still miss kirk rolling about the desert scrub with a seven foot man in a rubber reptile costume , but how will picard defeat those assimilating half-man , half-machine entities that are heading his way ? he better " make it so " with season three . season 3 it was the dawn of the 90s and since cgi had undergone some development , the improvements can be seen not only in the new opening sequence , but with better looking planets ( complete with moving gaseous atmospheres ) and major enhancements in particle effects . towards the end it undergoes new model development , lighting and subspace effects of a movie budget look . the crew uniform has changed with a new type of collar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker ( now with a bigger belly ) , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( letting his hair grow even more ) , commander deanna troi ( with more makeup , costume changes and even an aerobics outfit [that really is n't as good as it sounds] ) , lieutenant commander data and ensign wesley crusher ( new hairdo ) . dr. beverly crusher is back ( initially with a terrible hairdo that gets better ) and doctor katherine pulaski has been dropped from the show never to reappear again . pulaski 's disappearance is not officially explained ( in reality diana muldaur was told her character was not working and she was offered a role in l.a. law instead . mcfadden was asked to rejoin the series again ) the crew do act like she has just left because her time was up with dr. crusher making reference to pulaski 's work in episode four . commander lieutenant tasha yar makes a surprise guest appearance for one episode ! dwight schultz ( murdoch from the a-team ) makes his first appearance as lieutenant ` reg ' barkley , who would have a reoccurring role . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien , navigation , does n't have much of a role boost since season two , while the whoopi goldberg 's guinan character of the wise el aurian , the bartender in 10 forward , has her background further developed . season three of tng is mostly about nanotechnology , colonization , super aliens , the prime directive , orphans , ancient space booby traps , romulans , wormholes , peace negotiations , defectors , super humans , terrorism , q , court inquisitions , parallel universes , ai , klingon high councils , captivity experiments , time travellers , biological space crafts , morale , the first law of robotics , vulcans , sarek , evolutionary speciation , and the borg . unlike season two there is much more planetary exploration and lots of alien encounters . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , " evolution " where nanotechnology takes over the enterprise , " the survivors " is a mystery about a single household that is the only structure to survive an alien invasion on a whole planet , " who watches the watchers ? " is about the prime directive failing when the enterprise team are spotted and kidnapped , " offspring " sees data creating another sentient android , " sins of the father " has worf return to his klingon homeworld to defend his family honour , " hollow pursuits " has lt. barkley fantasizing about crew members in the holodeck , " sarek " is about the vulcan of the same name from star trek : the original series , who is back for what looks like his final peace negotiation , and of course the pot-boiler end episode of " the best of both worlds , part i " ( widely acclaimed as one of the best star trek episodes ever ! ) marks the grand entrance of locutus of borg onto the scene . the bottom line for tng : season three is that it is often cited by fans as the best tng season and is probably the first of the seasons to really be worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . in season three everyone seems to have matured , included the writers who are giving us exactly what we want and the series has a serious enough budget to make every episode look like a movie , especially towards the end . there is lots in this season to enjoy and of course not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that " the best of both worlds , part i " would deliver on , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there is no time to loose ! ! ! onto season four . .... wooosshhhh . season 4 not since j.r. ewing had been shot did we get the kind of cliff-hanger episode that " the best of both worlds , part i " would deliver on at the end of season iii , meaning every trekie ( and who was n't at this time ) across the planet from la to hong kong had to wait all summer to learn how picard could be saved . there was no time to lose ! ! ! onto season four . .... wooosshhhh.. . so here we are . with season three it was the dawn of the 90s and cgi had undergone some development and improvements ( better looking planets with moving gaseous atmospheres , particle effects , lighting and subspace effects ) . with season three things started to have more of a movie budget look . season four tries to maintain that class . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf ( who keeps growing that hair ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data , dr. beverly crusher and ensign wesley crusher ( now a starfleet officer with full uniform , also departs from tng half way through this season , and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien and whoopi goldberg 's guinan . lots of characters who had small episode roles are back for season four such as worf 's lover k'ehleyr , the traveller , k'mpec the klingon leader , duras whose dishonesty caused worf 's discommendation and the romulan tomalak . there is also a surprise character at the end of this season . season four of tng is mostly about the borg , family , dr. soong and the ai emotion chip , adoption , the space-time continuum , hostage rescue , the klingon high council , romulans , alternative universes , holographic projection , survival , loosing special abilities , renegade captains , the devil , amnesia , first contact , love , nightmares , mutations , super intelligence , robin hood , witch hunt trials , euthanasia , host life forms , mind control and honour . like season three most the episodes in season four have great stories , combining both planetary exploration and the life of the crew instead of dealing with either one or the other as the initial seasons did . it is a well balanced season overall and a good deal more exciting than maybe its three previous seasons now that things are firmly established . apart from containing part ii of ` the best of both worlds ' , the introduction of the cardassians , who would become major players in the star trek : deep space nine franchise , makes it even more valuable . there are loads of unforgettable episodes in this season , ` the best of both worlds , part ii ' concludes the cliff-hanger from season three with some great battle special effects , ` family ' has picard going home to see his brother and family , ` brothers ' features dr. soong who is data 's creator , ` reunion ' returns to the story of worf and his klingon dishonour , ` the wounded ' features the cardassians for the first time , ` clues ' has data disobeying picard , ` first contact ' sees riker exposed as an alien on a planet he is monitoring , the ` the nth degree ' has barclay taking control of the enterprise with his new special powers of intelligence , ` qpid ' for its historical recreation of robin hood and of course ` redemption , part i ' which deals with worf 's dishonour . the bottom line for tng : season four is that it keeps up the pace of season three , and is worth the price tag demanded of these very expensive box sets . everyone has matured and the writers are giving us exactly what we want . although not quite the cliff-hanger end episode that " the best of both worlds , part i " was , ` redemption , part i ' still concerns the loss of a main character to the other side and introduces the surprise return of a person we know . we are left asking ourselves , if the ` hard man ' is really gone and why does ` she ' look like a romulian ! as picard would say " i can live with a mystery " but we just ca n't ! onto season five as quick as we can.. . season 5 season 5 has a remarkable improvement in visual effects . the display panels on the enterprise are more interactive . the camera can now pan as special effects take place . deep space battles seem more intense . we also get a new star trek title graphic in the opening sequence . the cliff-hanger conclusion of " redemption , part ii " is a great episode although slightly lacking in the promise of a civil war battle between klingons , romulans and the federation , turns out to be more of a character episode than the big epic battler we thought we would get . none-the-less , it is still a good episode that reveals some things about the family of tasha yar . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard ( with a new red suede coat and grey uniform ) , commander william t . riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge ( who sports a new beard in one episode ) , lieutenant commander worf ( who left the enterprise in season four ) , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining three seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien as is whoopi goldberg 's guinan . alexander rozhenko as worf 's son now has a reoccurring role since season four . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is firmly established as a reoccurring character . watch out for the special appearances of ashley judd as ensign robin lefler and leonard nimoy as spock ! whoot ! whoot ! strangely enough this is the only season where q , of the omnipotent q continuum , does not make an appearance . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is also absent from this season . season four of tng is mostly about the klingon high council , romulans , communication , bajora , crystalline entities , disasters , addiction , reunification , time travel , parenting , telekinesis , eugenics , amnesia , possession , euthanasia , sexual repression , time warps , children , cover-ups , sexual attraction , imaginary friends , borg , invisibility , alternative lives and phase shifting . like season four most the episodes in season five have great stories , a perfect balance of planetary exploration and the life of the crew . it much more of the same as in season four with the better episodes being ` redemption , part ii ' , ` darmok ' an interesting episode about language , the introduction of the bajora and ensign ro , the silicon avatar makes a return , ` unification ' , part i and ii ( both here ) with spock may be one of the most popular double episodes in the whole tng franchise , certainly more popular than ` time 's arrow ' , part i which ends this season with the possibility of something strange happening to data on earth . ` the masterpiece society ' shows what happens when a special genetically engineered race has contact from the outside world . huge of borg also makes his first appearance in ` i , borg' . apart from the ` unification ' double episode , the instalments ` ethics ' , about worf undergoing a major controversial surgical operation and ` the game ' , when entertainment becomes mind control , have both achieved cult status as some of the best tng episodes ever aired . season five unfortunately has some dull episodes too , many of which occur in the second half of the season , so the best stuff is within the first four discs . it does n't really create much drive to push for a quick follow up with season six , but no doubt because six is as good as five was , then we are there for it . as a note : " redemption part ii " - this episode received as 12 age rating in the uk , because it contains klingon ritual head butting . ` violations ' also has sexually violent content ( psychic rape ) . parents may want to be cautious and view those two episodes before showing it to children . if you are going to move onto season six then you will probably want to know that during season six the crew make contact with deep space nine . so if you get deep space nice : season one you can sync up the star dates and watch both franchises in chronological order . if you are in for six you may also be in for season one of ds9 ! season 6 season 6 is generally considered the pinnacle of the series for the wind down to the season 7 conclusion and of course the wake of popularity that star trek , deep space nine : season 1 whipped up while season 6 was running . 1993 was tv sci-fi heaven with fans getting a double dose of st for the year . this means for the folks who have been watching tos and tng , now is the time to do a special chronological order of star dates alternating between tng season 6 and ds9 season 1. you can find the order if you search the new for it . tng has really good stories while ds9 gets the effects . we are no longer happy to see a new interactive flat panel as the driving force of a story . season 6 answers with substance to characters and stories with some surprises ( picard acting like a russian is hysterical . would you sacrifice his authority role for that quality humour from him from time to time ? maybe yes ! ) . the conclusion of " time 's arrow " is not the best cliff-hanger but sufficient . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for some episodes but is mainly replaced by the new ensign ro laren , a bajoran . colm meaney is here again as miles edward o'brien but will be transferred to ds9 ( his absence is not mentioned ) . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is back along with alexander rozhenko . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) will also leave for ds9. lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer is back after being absent from season 5. season 6 of tng is mostly about transporter psychosis , empaths , scotty ! , alien abductions , q , age regression , android dreams , artificial life , cardassians , prof . moriarty , love , romulan defection , destiny , klingon birthrights , thieves , command ethics , origins of life , insanity , murder , faith , doubles , time travel and the borg . like season 5 most the episodes in season 6 have above average sci-fi stories , combing planetary exploration and the life of the crew . memorable episodes include , a fistful of datas , the quality of life , ship in a bottle , face of the enemy , birthright and lessons . there are three very good episodes which really make the season worth . tapestry sees picard given the opportunity to relive his youth without the night he fought with a gang who stabbed him through the heart . suspicion is a great whodunit episode ( of which there are a few ) with one of the coolest star trek aliens ever ( should have made him a main character ) . descent part i is a very nice slight of hand trick . you will keep thinking hugh right up until the last second . season 7 star trek : season 7 is of course winding down to a conclusion , making way for some star trek films , but in reality it is deep space nine : season 2 ( ds9 : season 1 starts in star date chronological order with tng : season 6 ) that is the new trek . fans of star trek got their twofold measure of these series through 1993 and 1994 making it an exceptional sf tv era . the conclusion of " descent , part ii " has the finale of lore . most of the main characters from season two are here , captain jean-luc picard , commander william t . riker , lieutenant commander geordi la forge , lieutenant commander worf , commander deanna troi , lieutenant commander data and dr. beverly crusher . ensign wesley crusher ( who departed from season four half way and has a recurring role instead of a main character in the remaining seasons ) returns for one episode . while ensign ro laren , a bajoran , was supposed to replace him , she only appears in one episode in season 7 , although the episode is a major one focused on her . colm meaney shows up again as miles edward o'brien for the last episode . whoopi goldberg 's guinan is gone without explanation ( see the movie " star trek : nemesis " on her ) . alexander rozhenko is back . keiko o'brien , ( miles o'brien 's wife ) is not here either ( after leaving for ds9 ) . lieutenant reginald barclay , engineer , is back again . season 6 of tng is mostly about lore , emotional studies , interfaces , mercenaries , nightmares , psychic trauma , beverly and picard , warp travel environmental damage , data 's mother , alternate realities , the pegasus , worf 's human brother , incubus , top secret missions , radiation sickness , deities , troi and worf , reverse evolution , wesley and the traveller , klingon right of ascension , picard 's son , abiogenesis , ro laren and time travel . while there are some hit and miss episodes and a really terrible one ( " masks " for example is one of the worst of the entire franchise ) most are well above average and some are incredible . memorable episodes include , gambit , forces of nature , inheritance , lower decks , thine own self , journey 's end and bloodlines . the pegasus is probably the best episode of the season , but the finale " all good things.. . " is really where it is at with some good aging effects , a possible future with an older looking cast and an futuristic enterprise to die for . the series ends very warmly and with a nicer note about the possibilities of looking within instead of charting stars and galaxies for a newer greater trek . in short there is nothing like st:tng . it evolved tv serials into mega media and ran for a full span of 7 years . it set a new benchmark and placed the bar as high as the stars . all we can say about this awe-inspiring series can be summed up in one word.. . ...amen .	2
i found a supposedly " new remastered edition " of sade 's " diamond life " on sale for less than 10 bucks . oops ! great mistake ! when i tried to return it , the cd store was already out of business , and the copy is one issued in the netherlands which is marked into the booklet as " 2000 digital remastered version " . the whole album has been re-recorded with new arrangements ! the digital sound is quite good , but the new arrangements made for ' smooth operator ' really sucks ! !	4
this movie is asome its one of my favorites from the 90 's and probably my favorite plot twister / who done it along with m night shamylans films . this movies great plot is over looked by the average americans craving desire of sex and scandal which is retarded and makes this country alittle less than great . anyway the shear sex appeal is also one of the tones that makes this movies atomasphere so great the music hits it perfect and the 2 leads are my favorite younger actress ' neve campbell and denise richards who are both perfect for they 're rolls . the whole movie is just oozing with sex appeal that combined with the story makes it irresistable . which is unexpected from john mcnaughton as it was his first big claim to fame film . bill murray adds some much needed comic releif and the plot will keep you guessing till the end and will fool anyone even those retards from csi . the 2 girls have " it " in theyre rolls they just seem to fit together like a sexy peanut butter and jelly sandwhich . i was fist drawn to this film ever since i meet matt dillon at universal studios he was just asome and i had to see him act , and everyone recommended this movie for that and he was asome in it to . infact i wouldnt mind meeting the whole cast all of them are huge idols of mine and theyre all so cool . i do miss neve campbell. . i wish she 'd come back to films and it looks like she will . so if your looking for a once in a lifetime plot and an asome cast this movie has it or if your like the 99.9% of people who have seen this and you only like it for the threesome and the pool scenes then i guess its good for that to since ive only seen the editied verison . ps dont waste ur time with the other sequals theyre stupid and repeats of this one with not so famous casts . take a look at the fist still at the bottom it sums up the whole " it " thing i was taking about you just feel an incredible amount of " cool " form that shoot , well i did anyway	2

it 's not because it 's so slow that i hate it , it 's because microsoft has decided that i 'm too stupid to know what i 'm doing so they 've decided to protect me from myself and wo n't allow me to even look at what 's on my hard drive . every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing . it 's so confusing to look at my documents folders , i ca n't figure out what is where . i ca n't view web pages on my own site because they are n't in the security frame of safe . all my usb wifi devices do n't work on vista and the only ones available are extremely expensive . my cousin bought a vista installed laptop and with customer support could n't get it connected to his wifi router at home because of security issues , so he took it back and got one that has xp media center on it for less . i was given a full , licensed copy of vista ultimate and i will not install it on any of my computers . if ms stops supporting xp and i have only vista available in a pc , i 'll buy an apple	5
this book depicts the essence of the african american struggle and not just from a woman 's prospective but from an universal one . the women and the men in this book are victims evenly . naylor is a literary star and her poetic prose is her spotlight , which glows undyingly in this classic novel . a must read .	0

how can you rate something that has n't been released ? especially since lionsgate ruined season 5 by releasing the shortened syndicated versions while still writing on the box " the complete 5th season " . debbie harry is credited on the box while her scene was omitted . this along with many others.. . they completely ruined the boxed set by issuing shortened , crappy syndicated episodes . this is coming from a huge w&g fan , or should i say k&j fan	2
this is lovely stuff . the other reviews say why much better than i can , but i just had to add to the adoration	4
i ordered this hoping that it would fit my camera and accessories and it did . i have a stylus 750 plus a pop up screen shade , an extra battery , and an extra picture card . there are two slots specifically designed to fit two picture cards on the inside cover . in the main compartment , a small slit will fit an extra battery or two plus a creit card and perhaps a bit of paper money . ( it wo n't fit much more than that , though . ) it 's compact , stylish and functional- -i 'm glad i bought it	1
with this pup it is simple to record video or images and almost impossible to download them successfully ! in standard mode , the playback of video is anything but smooth . looks like an old time movie . the software could best be described as , " user hostile " . i have n't been able to download any videos without getting an error message before the transfer is complete . the normal video is n't as good as my dv camcorders and downright sad indoors . the photo portion is slightly better than my cell phone ( a pocket pc ) . still pictures have n't downloaded successfully either ( approximately 11 out of 185 have made it across the wire before error messages start interrupting the transfer ) . it 's a handy size and easy to operate . after you 're done recording you 'll likely spend a lot of time with the manual ( i have ) and then you start getting frustrated . if i could return it , i would	1
screenwriter charlie kaufman 's reality-bending work has become such a hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts . he dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories . directed by michel gondry , this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception , as kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one 's memory . at the same time , gondry and kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky . the labyrinth plot focuses on shy , taciturn joel barish , who is swept off his feet by the raucous , unstable clementine . much to his dismay after a particularly ugly fight , he discovers that clementine has impulsively decided to erase all memory of her relationship with him through a medical company called lacuna headed by the benevolent dr. mierzwiak . a renowned leader in his field of memory erasure , mierzwiak treats the heartbroken joel to the same procedure as clementine's . however , joel is overcome by the intensity of emotion from this act of reciprocation and starts rebelling against the deep consciousness treatment to regain his memories of clementine . the surreal twists and turns that occur boggle the mind of the viewer but not in a way that alienates us from joel 's plight . it helps that a sturdy cast has been recruited starting with a surprisingly subdued jim carrey as the depressed joel . this is easily his most effective attempt at a straight dramatic role even though gondry allows him to provide flashes of his manic personality when appropriate . displaying no trace of her corseted britishness as the bedraggled free spirit clementine , kate winslet shows the right level of abandon and leavens it with her natural earthiness . tom wilkinson is his usual steady self as the somewhat remorseful mierzwiak , while his spirited trio of assistants is played with relish by kirsten dunst , mark ruffalo and elijah wood . all three are fine with dunst particularly affecting toward the end . the looping narrative could have spiraled out of control had it not been for the stellar work by cinematographer ellen kuras , production designer dan leigh and editor valdis oskarsdottir , all combining to bring much-needed fluidity to initially incoherent scenes . the only fly in the ointment is jon brion 's overly intrusive music . the 2004 dvd has several extras , the best of which is the consistently informative commentary track by gondry and kaufman , which helps explain some of the more bizarre plot turns . there are two featurettes - a standard ten-minute making-of short and a fifteen-minute conversation with gondry and carrey that borders on banal . seven minutes of understandably excised scenes are included , as well as a creative music video of the polyphonic spree 's " night and day " and a faux-commercial for lacuna	2
bayer is a name-brand aspirin . any brand-name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin . i give this a one-star rating not because it is a poor product , rather , because it is so expensive . the dosage is 81 mg , taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes ( generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis , have had a heart attack or stroke ) . aspirin is a wonder-drug , the very first analgesic / anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago . it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , and even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other , thus it " thins " the blood and prevents blood clots from forming . aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes . some folks take a " baby " aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day to prevent blood clots from forming . aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion , to make digestion easier . some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . for these folks , the buffered form is a god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out of favor in the 60 's and 70 's when reye 's syndrome developed in some children ( under the age of 16 ) who took aspirin while they had the flu and / or chickenpox . about 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage . because of reye 's syndrome , alternate analgesics were placed on the market , the premier being tylenol . there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult , as reye 's syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age . the usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg , with the " extra-strength form at 500 mg . most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5 , 200 mg . ( some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg / day with a doctor 's supervision ) . there is no additional benefit to taking more than 1 , 000 mg every 4 hours . increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin . aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications , those with stomach ulcers , and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies can develop to aspirin as well . never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such as ibuprofen , as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased . do n't mix aspirin with alcohol either , as it is hard on the stomach . used properly , aspirin is a terrific medication . i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form . one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer . however , the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better . jim " konedog " koenig	3
i 've had this battery for 3 months . so i do n't have long term experience . but so far it 's been excellent . no better or worse then the original canon battery . i would reccomend it to anyone .	1
my first aquis mitt was rectangular . i like this one better . rounding the edges makes sense since it is meant to be worn on the hand . aquis microfiber is the only fabric i use on my face . it is gentle on the skin , yet cleans more thoroughly than anything else i have used . ( i find it amazing that both attributes apply to the same fabric ! ) if the manufacturer is listening , i would like to be able to buy the mitts in sets of 2. this would be perfect for bathing baby / children . there is a slit in the seam , on the thumb side , so your thumb can protrude . you can grip / lift without removing your mitts . some size choices ( s / m & l / xl ) would be nice , as this mitt would not fit a large man 's han	3
this camcorder worked well , but i had two complaints with it . 1. on the sound track you can hear noise from the recording head moving back and forth , sounds like a woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted to do . 2. i wanted high quality video , but since it records on a small dvd disk , the video is compressed before it is recorded on the disk . this causes some loss of detail in the picture , especially if you 're going to edit it and rerecord the video which i need to do . if you just want a camera to record a small dvd which you can then play in a dvd player ( and not all dvd players will play the small dvds ) this camera might be acceptable . i returned it and bought a panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses the minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , and no noise from the tape drive	1
as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months	1
this pitcher is designed so that when you try to empty it - - pour out all the water - - the filter comes crashing out ! it 's top-heavy . i much prefer my dispenser that lives in the fridge . it may be clumsy to refill - - which is why i thought i 'd try a pitcher - - but it 's extremely easy to use	3
i was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies , but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing . i will not bore you with the reviews of these movies , those who love akira kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of shakespeare , a clint eastwood western , and star wars . for the price and what you get , it 's a steal	2
once again i truly benefitted from another ellen barrett workout dvd . her cueing , instruction and professionalism show it . she knows how to turn what some consider a tedious plain exercise into a spot on fun , enjoyable and worth it workout !	2
this movie would get 5 stars if it were not carressing with one hand - portraying the gospel of john beautifully through the movie - and slapping yahushua / jesus and serious scholars in the face with the other hand . the so-called " scholarly " comments , for example about how the gospel was written 200 years after the events , are by and large intellectually dishonest and quite simply inaccurate . even the lowliest of bible scholars , if honest , will realize this . it is very sad to see people making a buck off the bible , while trying to tear it down at the same time . the worst examples of scripture put downs are in the 3rd dvd . i gave the movie to a relative without that add on	2
the relaxation set is just that , pure relaxation . i love the active relaxation cd . i can read or work and i am real calm , on an even keel , feeling like when you go to sleep at night , not quite asleep and not quite awake . i also enjoy the water and the piano playing . highly recommended	4
. . .maybe believe your suspenders , i 'm not sure which . it seems to me that to enjoy this book , you have to suspend your suspicion of bombast and improbability . you also have to give up any qualms you might have about a protagonist who 's pretty much a pedophile and whose connection to planet earth seems pretty improbable . what you get in return are some amazing language , some great observations and a character whose zenny zest is intense but not cartoonish . much too cerebral to ever be made into a movie by any director alive now , this is a book to be enjoyed as a pure artifact of whacked-out , but craftsman-like writing	0
never be sick again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease . i am a biochemist doing medical research at ucla . a friend gave me this book to read , and i was very skeptical . after reading it , i could n't stop thinking about what it was saying . i even lost sleep thinking about it . after many weeks , i have come to a conclusion - the author is right . there is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary ! once you understand this simple concept , it changes everything . if your mind is not closed to new ideas , the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better . it will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease . with this new understanding , from now on , i will approach my research in an entirely different way . c.l	0
i was thoroughly disappointed . the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed - - words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site , first fogware had not sent me a coupon , then i had to deal with bad customer service ( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support ) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box , the online info is exactly what we have in the cd - - so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out	5
i had higher expectations when i purchased this dvd . i was not disappointed technically but i was extremely disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of rachel york . she could n't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop , jazz , or traditional musical theatre sound . her voice was all over the place . furthermore , i found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable . i preferred kathryn grayson 's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable , witty , and charming , as well as screechy , demanding , and somewhat tyrannical . truly , i could barely watch this entire video and at the end i could have cared less if fred and lilli got together . i think that was the most powerful statement for me . the production was acted ( or directed ) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top . can today 's directors please leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves ? everything need not be a commentary ! i wish i had seen marin mazzie because i heard she was incredible . rent this before buying it or better yet do what i did and buy it used . it hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth	2
i was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch live 8 and certainly regretted that . however , i was fortunate enough to find this copy at amazon and it 's been everything i had expected and more . i 'm a huge pink floyd fan and their performance alone was worth the price of the box set not to mention all of the other fantastic performances . i would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation- -truly a " must have " for anyone 's collection !	2
this 1989 debut album from this texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from jason mcmaster , catchy guitar riffs , and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.it fits quite nicely in my cd collection in the " d " column next to the dirty looks cd.i thought " scared " was the best song on here along with the opener , " teasin pleasin " and " queen of the nile " but i liked all of them.the best way to describe dangerous toys is that it has a heavy guns n roses sound with a poppier edge to it.it 's too bad they never made a good album after this one and dangerous toys would never get to this level again.if you want late 80 's hard rock / metal without the spandex and the makeup , this debut album is highly recommended.nothing fancy , just good old fashioned rock and roll	4
this arrived the other day , i pre ordered it . two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion . its about time this was available on cd and here it is . sounds great ! go get it for the collection	4
the synopsis ... sam and jonah baldwin , father and son , have lost the most important woman in their lives to cancer . seeking to escape from the painful memories that lurk in every nook and cranny of chicago , they move to seattle . eighteen months later , jonah can sense that his dad is still sad ; and , in desperation calls a nationally syndicated radio self-help guru on christmas eve to wish for his father a new wife . annie reed lives in baltimore and is engaged to walter . their relationship , while loving and comfortable , is entirely devoid of romantic sparks . when annie hears jonah 's soulful plea on the radio , it 's as if her heart has been touched by " magic " and she is determined to find out why she feels so powerfully drawn to sam and his son ... even if it means traveling across " like 26 states " . the critique ... sleepless in seattle is a brilliantly simple film ; that 's what makes it so great . to quote nora ephron , " it is n't a movie about love , it 's a movie about love in the movies . " to emphasize this point , she incorporates various parallel references to " an affair to remember " throughout the film ; but , sleepless is also a movie about our genuine romantic fantasies and sentimental ideals about falling in love ( which , let 's admit it , have been undeniably shaped by what we 've seen on the silver screen ) . the script is refreshingly candid , yet endearing and nora ephron 's direction is impeccable . ross malinger , cast as jonah baldwin , is the youngest and most notable talent in the film . he does an excellent job of portraying the quintessential eight-year-old ; he 's impulsive , moody and thinks he knows it all . ( i speak from experience here folks ; i currently have a son that age . ) he and tom hanks come together flawlessly as father and son ; so successfully in fact , that they would be utterly convincing off screen . the chemistry between meg ryan and tom hanks is equally amazing , which is no small achievement considering the fact that they rarely appear together in a scene . the supporting cast is brimming with talent and includes rosie o'donnell , bill pullman , rita wilson , rob reiner , david hyde pierce , and a young gaby hoffmann . families with younger children will appreciate the film 's integrity ; there is very little foul language ( " god damn it " and " ... it scared the shit out of me ... " being the worst of it ) and no " sexual content " to be wary of . all around , this is a winning film . one that i find myself watching over and over and over again . the dvd ... for a 10th anniversary edition , the special features are few and rather disappointing . you 've got your basic director commentary , a music video ( " when i fall in love " by celine dion & clive griffin ) , and a " love in the movies " featurette . this last piece is approximately 15 minutes long . it features the director , producers , actors and the hosts of loveline : drew pinsky and adam carolla ( why they are included , i do n't know ) talking about " love in the movies . " there are some interesting interview segments with an empire state building historian and some very beautiful shots of the new york skyline before 9 / 11 ; but there 's certainly nothing here to write home about . by far , the most exciting feature is that you can choose your aspect ratio . ( and honestly , how exciting is that ? ) this a dvd that you buy for the film alone .	2

the text gets 5 stars for the orientation , organization , and the on-line resources for the text . it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course . unfortunately , i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make . this has been frustrating for my students , as well as myself . however , i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up , the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market . i strongly recommend a new , corrected edition	0
daniel deronda is george eliot 's 1876 novel dealing with the rise of zionism incarnated in young daniel deronda . sadly but truly this is the first major english novel giving a positive view of the jewish people . deronda is raised by the wealthy sir malinger as an english gentleman . in the course of the long novel and miniseries he learns he is a jew ; meets his mother and is the love object of two fascinating women . mirah lapidoth is the jewish musician who is rescued from suicide by daniel . her love for daniel burgeons as she comes to know and love the kind young man . gwendolyn harleth played by the brilliant acting of romola garai is the spoiled , impecunious husband hunter who weds the rich cad grandcourt only to rue her unwise choice of mates ! she loves deronda as her marriage becomes a torture chamber of psychological combat . like all bbc productions this one is photographed in beautifully rich colors . the scenery is beautiful and the musical score is haunting to the ear . this tale runs about four hours and is a joy.many american viewers may be dismayed at the slow , leisurely pace of british productions . please remember that these productions are based on long english novels which were published in several monthly parts . they are long but they are also wonderful explorations of the human soul . gwendolyn 's story is a bildungsroman in which she grows as a person . ditto for deronda who learns to take pride in his hebrew heritage . this is a worthy bbc production well worth the viewer 's time and money	2

this game was a little too hard for my tastes . despite the fact that i played at the junior level i managed to get killed shortly after starting out . i also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once i left the room i could n't find my way back ( all the corridors look alike ) . so far i 've fallen down an elevator shaft , gotten caught breaking and entering , been crushed by an elevator , frozen to death and been hit over the head...i 've got to ask is this really appropriate for children	5
i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable ( i shoot birds at 700mm ) . the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses / cameras etc. - one with , one without , the extender . result : - the image appeared the same size , and the extender slightly blurred the image . in other words - completely useless	1
i am not a right winger whatsoever , am against our involvement in the mid east but did read this book . i ca n't say it better than alan dershowitz who commented about chomsky 's writing in general : many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16	0

if you 're looking for a video that does n't take a lot of time , then this is one that you should add to your collection . it does n't matter if you 're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years , there are two levels to suit both challenges . 10 minutes is spent on abs , buns & amp ; thighs . you can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes . the exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles . if you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet , you 'll easily lose inches and tighten up those & quot ; loose&quot ; areas	2

if you look at my review history , you may note that i 've given very few five-star reviews . i save five stars for outstanding products . i believe wordperfect x3 is best described as outstanding . a long time ago , i used word perfect . however , my earlier jobs required i use ms word , so i did my best to become a word guru . i believe i accomplished that short of creating custom macros . as a law clerk , i started a new job where wordperfect was the standard . so , last year i bought wordperfect 12. at first it was difficult , but i bought a book that helped me fill in the blanks . with the ability to customize keyboards and the fact that wordperfect gives the author a great degree of control ( especially with show-codes ) , i was soon able to become a wordperfect guru . i remembered all the things i used to love about wordperfect . like any lover , i also learned to ignore some of the blimishes of wordperfect . ( one of those blemishes is the behavior of pushing a change from that point of the document forward , which , once you get accustomed to it , is really a nice feature . ) wordperfect and pdfs are the two accepted file formats for electronic submission to federal courts . there were two complaints i found at work among word devotees : 1 ) the ability to export to pdf but not import and 2 ) the inability to cut from a word document into a wordperfect document without creating all the formatting litter word likes to use . 1. we occasionally receive pdfs that we would have to retype to be able to make edits . with the ability to import pdfs ( that is , those that were authored and exported into pdf , not documents scanned into pdf ) , we were now able to edit those pdfs . this was a real time saver . since pdf is the de facto universal standard amongst all platforms ( windows , mac , unix ) , this was a great improvement . 2. formatting litter is a real pain to deal with . i never could get a ms word document to just import into wordperfect without headaches in trying to fix the formatting . my solution was to copy the portion out of ms word , paste into a text file , copy again and then paste into wordperfect . my complaint was i could not just straight paste into wordperfect . well , corel heard my cry and provided the ability to copy just the text . the lone ms word holdout in my office capitulated with that . he has no more to complain about . another great thing about wordperfect is the fact that the file format for its documents has not changed in years ( i heard a wp rep say no change since 1995 ) . why should it ? everything you could want to do in a document ( perhaps barring professional typesetting ) can be done in wordperfect . there 's no need to create a new format when the one you have just works . this product does exactly what those who have come to love wp expect it to do . i think corel has done a good job of resolving my own personal quibbles with wp . so , if you 're looking for a solid performer that seeks to beat competition by improving itself , wpx3 is representative of what you 're looking for	5
i 'm not a fan of stephen king film adaptations . the only one i like is carrie bec it was directed by brian depalma and featured terrific performances by sissy spacek and piper laurie . cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful . i could n't wait for it to end . not worth purchasing . okay as a rental	2
what i learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page . sure , business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends , but this book did not deliver on facts and details . i do n't see much difference between this book and the guru-books	0
i was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product - - it 's as we we 've purchased entirely different programs . in my experience with this software , i 've found it to be extremely smooth-running and user-friendly from installation to printing , and the card selection and customization is second to none . there have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we 've customized them countless ways - - adding and editing photos , moving text , sending ecards , you name it ! navigating within the art studio is very intuitive . printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on-screen configuration works great . unlike some of the other reviews , i have n't had the problem of having to re-configure every time i print . we set it up once and that was it . i 've printed on card stock paper , which turns out gorgeous , and we 've also printed the quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size a2 envelopes ( this is a great printing option if you do n't want to buy card stock paper ! ) . i 've used this software on all of my computers , have recommended it to many people , and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems . i highly recommend it . it 's a fun program , the recipients will love their customized cards , and it will save you money in the long run	5
i watched this movie , not because i am into ms. milano , or her breasts , but because it was shot ( sadly ) at my high school- -shattuck-st . mary 's school in faribault , mn . does n't say much for the school , or for the faculty who had bit parts in it .	2
i am a huge thomas hardy fan , and i was not disappointed with this book . at first all the technical astronomical information was slow , but the love story started and that was forgotten . my only complaint about two on a tower is the ending . it seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages . it was n't realistic for viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later , considering she was only 33 at the end of the story . sir constantine was possessive , jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him . the bishop was full of himself - how is that worse ? a few years with him and all of a sudden she 's an old woman with a heart condition ? swithin comes back and says he 'll marry her , she 's overcome with joy and boom ! she dies in his arms . i also find it strange that neither swithin or viviette acknowledged that the boy was his . did n't people in the village realize who he looked like , since people were already suspicious of the lovers ? what will happen next , swithin takes his son in and marries tabitha lark ? a very good , sad , complicated romance	0
the friend who i purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too fast for her to keep up with . she is used to a two wheeled walker , but wanted one with a seat . she did n't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund . it turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund ; so she did n't return it . the lesson : better buy local if you 're not sure	3
this movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great , including a phenomenal cast , lead by cate blanchett , and great scenery and cinematography . the actors playing elizabeth , cecil , and walsingham spoke and acted admirably , each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling , but the words themselves rendered the performances useless . the director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material . they should have read elizabeth the first 's biography by elizabeth jenkins . it is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain : had the author and director been more historically accurate , they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in elizabeth , who is in turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love of her people , who had a private core described by her motto " semper eadem " , be always one . elizabeth ruled with her advisors , she was not totally ruled by them . she would not have put up with norfolk screaming at her across the council table , nor would burleigh have allowed it . cate blanchett 's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine , wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman ? the ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all . we are laughably given william cecil as wimpy and ineffective , and walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne . one of the reviews said that the director inspired rush to play walsingham much like the hindu god krishna . i suggest that he should have first read some english history	2

do not buy this camera , i repeat do not buy this camera ! just read the reviews and you 'll know exactly what i mean . lucky i got this piece of junk for christmas , so i did n't spend a dime on it . i opened the package before reading any reviews . now i wish i 've read the reviews before opening the box . i do n't care what setting you use , i tried them all and i have yet to take a picture any better than my cell phones camera . the lighting sucks , you either end up with dark pictures or super bright ones . i really wanted this camera to work , it looks sweet but sadly it ca n't take pictures .	1
they do n't seem small at all . i would agree that it 's like a size 3 , if you 're talking about toddler clothing , but the diaper size is different . my daughter wears 3t clothes , size 5 easy ups	3
excellent songwriting , guitar playing and overdubbing . another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive . days dawning , crying clown , fanfare are a few such songs . a few songs from wind of change , something 's happening , and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i 'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment	4
this camera is a decent enough camera , compact , easy to use and takes good quality video and still pictures and the battery life is excellent . the battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour . i acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so i never worry about running out of juice . i have only two complaints really , one minor and one major . the minor complaint is the fiddly little controls on the touch screen lcd viewfinder . i find i need to use my reading glasses to see what i 'm doing . the major complaint is transfering video to my computer via the ilink cable ( not supplied ) . i have never persuaded it to work . by browsing various camera fora on the web i am finding a complaint identical to mine with this model in particular as well as other sony models . the computer will recognize the camera in usb mode ( for capturing still pictures from the memory stick ) but does not see it at all when plugged in via ilink ( firewire / ieee 1394 ) . all indications are that my firewire port and cable are perfectly ok . sony tech support , both web chat based and phone , have no clue and because i am out of warranty it will cost a flat $210 to send it in and have them take a look at it . if all you want to do is connect the camera to your tv to playback the video you take , it 's a good camera . if video capture an editing is what you have in mind , buyer beware . because of this , i can only give the product 2 stars , other wise it would be a 5. update : i installed a new firewire pci card on my computer and using a new cable tried the video capture again . i also tried the camera on my neighbor 's mac ( on the theory that if a mac wo n't recognize it you really know you have a problem ) . the computer still wo n't recognize the camera . this camera has been used very little and definitely not abused . it was probably defective right out of the box and it appears to be a common problem . if you buy this , make sure you test all of its capabilities as soon as you get it . do n't wait like i did because i 'm out of warranty and it will cost me to get the problem fixed	1
gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music , and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice . considered by some to be " hard country " , i find gene watson to have a more " pop " oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs ; and in the ' 70 's , that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts . while many of the songs on this album are pure country , others are the typical , drab , 70 's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80's . in any case , there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music , and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today ; including his signature songs " farewell party " and " love in the hot afternoon " . if you prefer the more traditional country sound , his " you could know as much about a stranger " and " should i come home " are also included	4
i received this for christmas from my amazon wishlist . i wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing . i was a long time user of norelco shavers , but switched to a blade since i could n't get a close enough shave . now that the whiskers are mostly gray , you ca n't tell for a few days if i shaved or not , so closeness is no longer an issue . i typically use this shaver in the shower , and have noticed that if you wash your face first , it takes more of the cool skin creme to give a smooth , close shave . just a hint , guys . for the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles , dimples and adam 's apple cleanly with very little drag . my only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the ' stash & sideburns while showering . small complaint that does n't remove any ratings stars . all in all a great shaver	3

in terms of both format and style , " rent " - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition . yet , it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters . in more traditional musicals , the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable , flesh-and-blood human beings . this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like " phantom of the opera , " which seems a natural for this type of approach , but with material like " rent , " which is small in scale and intimate in scope , the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience . i know that this play ( and , perhaps now , even the movie ) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers " rent " practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism , but to someone , like myself , coming cold to the work , " rent " adds up to much less than the sum of its parts . the story , a modern day update of " la boheme " set in greenwich village , starts on christmas eve , 1989 , and ends on christmas eve , 1990. this was at the height of the aids epidemic , and , indeed , many of the film 's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease ( aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story ) . there 's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists ( one is tempted to call them " deadbeats " ) from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block . " rent " - with its noble " performance artists " doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies - feels less like a relic from the ` 80 's than one from the ` 60's . though intended to be the heroes of the piece , the artists and bohemians often come across as naï¿½ve , painfully self-absorbed , and annoyingly self-righteous , an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend 's name ( the heavily allegorical " angel " ) as the password ( this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man ) . anything ` s better than actually working , i suppose , and becoming a tool of corporate america . when one of the men finally takes a dreaded " job " ( a mere sinecure , i might add ) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes ( horrors ! ) , he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan , and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-god paycheck . i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them . with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson , the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie , and even though their acting is n't all that impressive , some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing . in his direction , chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production , but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we 're watching . despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ , the film still feels stagy , over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene . as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen , only one tune strikes me as truly memorable , while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling . one of the problems , too , with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian , pedestrian and prosaic - when they are n't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of " the opposite of war is n't peace ; it 's creation " - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music . it 's not for nothing that the sharks and the jets did n't actually sing out most of their confrontations . there are , admittedly , some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters , but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture . in that one crucial moment , the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce , taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it . i don ` t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for " rent " ( or of its many devoted followers ) , but it ` s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially " sensitive " artists - should be allowed to live on other people ` s properties for free	2
love this battery . long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
" doctor livingstone i presume ? " is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history . very few people , however , are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr. david livingstone and henry morton stanley . this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together . livingstone , one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river . through a combination of bad luck , poor planning , disease , weather , natives , etc. , livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika . henry stanley , a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher . this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place . the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated . this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader . i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage ( which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark ) and river of doubt ( dealing with theodore roosevelt 's exploration of the amazon basin . if you enjoyed either of these books , you will like this one as well . if you read this book and enjoy it , i highly recommend the other two	0
truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he / she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the " crawlers " attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force	2

i was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program . setting up the query parameters is easy & the amount of info concerning places of interest ( services , banks , transportation ) is substantial . about the only drawback i found was the quality of the help contents , which was not very user friendly . most of the time i was unable to find solutions to my question / problem because the data was way too complicated ( displaying data in technical equations ) or was not listed at all . however , calls to technical support usually resolved the questions . finally , i was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map ( ie : a listing of addresses for your push pin locations ) . other than that , the program is very handy , loaded with tons of great data & the quality of the maps is superior .	5

contrary to purported performance claims , my experience with these batteries has significantly worsened my opinion of duracell 's products . decades of experience with everready energizers - and with other duracell products ( e.g. , coppertops ) - show procell products to be markedly inferior in performance . regardless of how long their shelf life may be , they simply have n't performed up to par , much less equally to other alkaline batteries . this has just been my experience - over daily use , over many months , with set after set of procell aa batteries . take it for what its ' worth	3
the music here frequently reminded me of pagan 's mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden . a fantastic mixture of 1970s progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european-style power metal and brazilian folk music . while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that do n't quite mesh . in actuality i give the cd 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired , sometimes flawed ambition . but as an overall package , this special edition of " temple of shadows " is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog . this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums ( not to mention it 's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves , smiling throughout the show ) . highly recommended .	4

tony kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of & quot ; the best&quot ; pilots around . his use of case studies of real pilots and real situations includes examples from the military , commercial , and geneal aviation communities . in short , the book is useful for any pilot whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed as a senior airline captain . for many pilots , it will reinforce what they already know and practice but for many , it will provide the opportunity to become & quot ; old&quot ; pilots . if you fly , read the book	0
i got this camera when it was rather new . i am not extremely pleased with it . it is not acting this way because it is 2 years old...it was like this when i bought it . -first of all...it has no lens cover so you have to keep it in a camera bag . incase you touch the lens without relizing...all your pictures will be ruined . -it takes for ever to take a picture . you have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken . -it eats up batteries like crazy -it takes forever to turn on -if you have the flash setting on autoflash , the camera will still flash in bright sunlight -the pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home -it has no optical zoom ( but the zoom is really the customer 's choice .	1
i was n't pleased with this book . i 've read all of ms. warren 's e-books and i have to say they have a lot more fire . she lost a lot in this book . somewhere around the middle of the book , i started thinking " did i actually buy a book this bad . " because i enjoyed her e books so much i did n't stop to think before purchasing it . i was so happy to have her book , i immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book . boy , did i get it from her the next day . because we do n't believe in throwing money away , we 're still stuggling to finish the book . hopefully , there is light at the end of the tunnel .	0
it 's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that xtc 's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70 's first wave of british punk rock . those were different times , after all . you could n't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky , spastic wit of & quot ; white music&quot ; . come to think of it , not many people could make much sense of it back then , either . andy partridge 's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than & quot ; pop&quot ; , and barry andrews ' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song . nevertheless , the album worked . it rocked in its own art-damaged way , and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation . that lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the fab four 's & quot ; hard day 's night&quot ; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to & quot ; this is pop&quot ; . a few songs later dylan 's & quot ; all along the watchtower&quot ; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia . there may have been more intense punk artifacts from the class of ' 78 , but not many were anywhere near as smart as & quot ; white music&quot ;	4

i remember when this recording came out and wynton marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz . i picked it up right away . i was mystified by the souless mimicry of art blakey 's jazz messengers and miles ' 2nd great quintet- -this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz ? listen as wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements , stopping on a dime ! marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars ! ! gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of think of one that strips the tune of any semblence of swing ! ! ! i get it , wynton- -you 've mastered the trumpet , technically speaking , which is no mean feat . and you can read music . bully for you . the only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say . ordinarily , i 'd feel sorry for you , having wasted all those hours of practice , except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you are n't worthy of washing . people like john coltrane , joe zawinul , miles davis , wayne shorter , herbie hancock...i could go on and on , but i think you get the point . this music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber , thus killing it .	4
it 's difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of alfred hitchcock 's masterworks , especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950 's until the 1960 classic " psycho " , but 1946 's " notorious " is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film . first , there is a sharp , intensely plotted script by the estimable ben hecht that focuses on alicia huberman , the daughter of a convicted nazi spy , and t.r. devlin , an american agent hired to convince alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo-nazis based in rio de janeiro . this means she would have to seduce and eventually marry alex sebastian , a key group member who has never gotten over alicia in his heart . this triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers . a primarily poker-faced cary grant portrays devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance . in a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism , devlin falls in love with alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her . claude rains , on the other hand , imbues sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a nazi war criminal a year after wwii ended , quite a daring feat within the film 's historical context . at the vortex , though , is ingrid bergman , who probably gives her most accomplished performance as alicia . at the time , she was deified as the chaste mother superior in leo mccarey 's harmless " the bells of st. mary 's " with bing crosby . bergman turned a smart corner here as a " loose " woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for devlin , at which point , she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the naïve sebastian to her alluring charms . ethereally beautiful and constantly pained , she conveys much of her character 's feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and grant portray two people who ca n't admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it . their failure to communicate leads to alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy . the chemistry between the two legends is palpable , especially in the then-controversial , three-minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy . however , above all , this is a hitchcock film , the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces , the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at sebastian 's mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into alicia 's hand clasping the cellar key , which she passes to devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles . there are intriguing performances on the sidelines with louis calhern as the head of the american agency in rio and the intimidating madame konstantin as alex 's ice-cold mother , both displaying a machiavellian spirit to get what they want . the criterion collection has done another masterful job with their dvd package , including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned hitchcock scholar marian keane providing insightful scene-specific analysis and film historian rudy behlmer . as was common with movie hits of the day , the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio , and the 1948 lux radio theater adaptation starring the voices of ingrid bergman and joseph cotten is included as well . there are also lots of still photos , a collection of trailers and teasers , and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal-retentive among us . this is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of hitchcock , bergman , grant or rains	2

melanie griffith , rachel leigh cook , and hugh dancy star in this straight-to-video film about one female transporter , who gets into trouble because of someone plotting against her . well , that 's all about it , apparently , but the film tries to give something unique to the otherwise unoriginal plot . i mean , the slightly original character of sarah by melanie griffth , who plays that smuggler in trouble . given a special job by malcom mcdowell with his customary ' i-could-be-very-baaaad ' smile , sarah agrees to carry a pack hidden in her bag . but as you know , someone also wants that package , and ... well , that 's nothing new , but she is attacked on the way . do n't expect any thriller , however . the film 's focus is not about that ; it is the relations about sarah and jack ( dancy ) who live together in a fancy paris apartment . but while sarah is away from paris on business , jack is attracted to a younger lady jenny ( cook ) who also falls for him . thus the film makes an effort to include both love and crime . nice try , considering this interesting point about the character of elder lady sarah , but if the factor is taken away from the film , the end result is nothing but a flat , tired suspence - - suspence as to its relations and its crimes alike . either way , the film is emotilnally very void . ok . two fatally bad things : one , too incredible characters . see , sarah is a professional courier who must know the rules of the job , which could be dangerous . but instead of renting a car ( and it 's europe , where that could be pretty easy ) , she takes a train ( and a night train ! ) in which she becomes an easy target . in this way , the film misses every chance to make it more suspenceful . when some character ( s ) must die , they die like characters in old video games - - they fall , that 's all . the other one ; acting . let me be honest . it was painful to watch the one-dimentional performance of melanie griffith , who was very good in ' another day in paradise . ' maybe she is not the greatest actor , but certainly she can act . but as far as ' tempo ' is concerned , no , i do n't think so . only the location of paris saves this film from utter forgettableness . forget about this one .	2
to set the record straight , rodney ' darkchild ' jerkins produced one song on this album , and that is ' he said' . that said , producer waryn ' baby dubb ' campbell [also husband of erika , younger of the duo] did a great job on this album . not at all to say that the ladies ' singing has n't always been phenomenal . the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song , a guest apperance by fred hammond on ' this love ' [their appearance on his album , speak those things ' is duly noted] , an impressively done cover of stevie wonder 's ' you will know ' , and a cover of walter hawkins ' ' thank you' . yes , that is the original sampled at the end of the song . every album that mary mary has released to this day [yes , all two of them] has proven that gospel music can be musically current- - impressive- - and still within taste . that 's what happens when you have the best on your team.. . baby dubb , while being mary mary 's resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard 's ' let go ' , ' sweetest thing ' , ' all i am ' , fred hammond 's albums ' speak those things ' and ' somethin ' ' bout love ' and countless other records . the downside : the last two songs . they 're of forgettable quality . while happy , forgettable . overall , this album is an essential	4
i ordered this movie for my husband . he loves it ! it 's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over . no big plot - but it 's got it 's moments . i 'm quite sure there is something for every european to be offended by.. . so keep a sense of humor and enjoy	2

i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally . but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably-where you ca n't even tell what you have taken . if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did , on this useless piece of crap	1
addressing as it does issues of cognition , language usage and acquisition , evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior , this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time . it is very readable for the most part , although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going . more illustrations would have helped here . there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging , cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain , but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage . pinker 's lively , humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing . he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting , then list a few more , then add " i could not resist some more.. . " and so on . i sometimes wished he would just get on with it . a major problem with his nativist approach , which other reviewers have commented on , is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind . most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book , linguists have been busy recording them in the field . the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter , where he argues that ' you and i ' and ' you and me ' are equally correct in all circumstances , because ' the pronoun is free to have any case it wants' . but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about ? if ' between you and i ' sounds instinctively wrong to me and ' between you and me ' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else , does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene ? i doubt it . the title itself is problematic . ' instinct ' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is , it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense . early in the book , pinker admits as much , but determines to use the word anyway , a use that owes more to marketing than to science . still , this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available . if you are new to linguistics , start here rather than with chomsky , but please go on to read geoffrey sampson 's work , perhaps starting with his website , to get an alternative view . as with most academic disputes , the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle . since chomsky 's early work , the nativists have toned down their claims considerably , while their opponents have made concessions . on page 34 of this book , pinker says , " no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene , but the search is on . " more than a decade later , the search is still on . good luck with that .	0
fellini brings light on space instead of space on light . he brings mysticism to the movie not the movie to mysticism . he brings boredom and rattling to a new height . lots of nice emotionalism and sweat . waging tongues and blood . candles and tits . bondage and perversion . we learn italian words that we can not use . here is a good tidbit " child of aphrodite and hermes...hermaphrodite .

good product amazon had a great price . even though people say it is high priced i paid $44 after discounts . i tried the beta version and i liked it . beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea . easy to install worked at the get go . intuitive enough to figure it out . you may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means . did n't have a manual with the beta version and still figured it out . manual does provide information , works great . did n't need any help . had mcafee before did n't find any new virus . it works as good as mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up . both kaspersky and mcafee have features i like .	5

i like this movie . a meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle , but we do n't think so almost always . the story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here . screenplay and performance of both bill nighy and kelly mcdonald have led this movie to the excellent one . ps : i do n't understand why this movie is not released in japan	2

i 'm a hobbyist musician and like to do home recordings . this program fits all of my basic needs . this is the first piece of audio software i 've ever owned but i know a lot of people who are more experienced are very unhappy with what i guess are unconventional layouts and commands so be warned if you 've used audition 1.5 or cooledit . however , as my introduction to music editing , the control scheme seems very intuitive to me and i like the endless options adobe provides for organizing the workspace . one tip : if you are a student or teacher , do n't spend $300 ; do a google search and find a site that sells this product for a little over $100.	5
do not buy this cd , the first two reviews said this is a good cd . nope . i 'll tell ya the real about this cd . i believe this was 305 's first cd , and i do n't see how this cd was ever in mass production . while it does have a few decent cuts most of this cd belongs to a different artist . 305 got much of the material for this cd on techmaster p.e.b 's masterpiece bass computer . any one who has both cd 's can tell . if your looking for bass , you 'll find it here . but you can find knock with any bass artist . i give this cd one star for biting techmaster	4
i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years . i was extremely happy with my olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i 'm expecting . this camera was such a disappointment . just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using the flash . i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . the first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14-day return policy . so , i sold the camera and took a $100 loss . i 'd much rather lose $[...] than keep this camera	1
i like the idea that michael lewis wrote this book / article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that . having said that i did not like this book : 1 ) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times . i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis ' point . 2 ) the story lacked the depth of lewis ' other wonderful books - where 's the who / why / what that lewis used to moneyball ( and others ) educational - i wanted the story behind the story . 3 ) who were all the pictures of ? i found them distracting.. . i 'll continue to read lewis ' books bu thope the next one is bette	0

i purchased this lens for my canon eos 20d digital camera and so far i really like it . it focuses fast and produces very sharp , clear images . as with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake ; i 've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots . i really like the 28-200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots . the lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed , which is typical for canon products . for the price range , this is an excellent lens . you can only do better by spending considerable more money on an is lens	1

overall , i was entirely disappointed with this camaera . the packaging and description were deceiving . there was no view finding screen , only a teeny , tiny window as in a regular camera . this was a gift for a child who would have had just as much fun with a throw away camera . i bought it because i wanted to give her a digital that had a large view finding screen . the construction would not hold up to a single drop on the ground . i would not recommend this to anyone	1
camera has good features and decent battery life for a " regular " camera . for those of you who do n't need a special camera and just want something that can take decent pictures . this is a good one . i like it	1
i 'm not sure what compelled me to seek out " americano , " written and directed by kevin noland . it 's not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson , a star of tv 's " dawson 's creek . " perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper 's inclusion in such a small scale production- -i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar . here , however , the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna , who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film . maybe it was international star leonor varela , a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america . most likely , though , it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain . with great scenery , bull fights , hemingway , hard drinking and partying , the running of the bulls- -the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing . however , i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film . i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works . the film is photographed well and has good performances . my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story . with an astounding lack of real character insight , this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat . the setup is simple . as recent college graduates , jackson and two pals ( who bicker comically ) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the " real " world and a new job . facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood , work and independence , freedom and monotony , dreams and reality- -jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela . should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance ? should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure ? should he stay in spain ? these are legitimate questions and a legitimate , albeit familiar , story path . what makes " americano " so tedious and uninvolving , however , is that the film does n't allow you to know its characters . a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off- -and " americano " does n't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation . we never know anything about jackson 's job or life in america , or his dreams , passions , interests , etc...aside from this fleeting romance . sure , the film goes through the requisite motions- -jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway , what else would you expect in spain ? if he has artistic aspirations , however , the screenplay surely never develops this . lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life , i simply fell into the camp of " who cares ? " there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture . dennis hopper 's role , however , as a club host is a complete misfire . ultimately , though , my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth . sure , jackson 's at a crossroads- -but lacking any understanding of what he wants , it made no difference to me what he chose . sorry , but that 's a big problem when it is your film 's central theme . kgharris , 02 / 07	2
i ordered a case for my kodak dx6490 digital camera from antonline thru amazon but received a case that is inches too small for my camera . if the numbers referenced above show in the review , you can see that my model of camera does not appear . in spite of this antoline has refused to issue an rma for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if i return without their rma . they tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened . the only packaging was a brown padded envelope . is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it ? i guess i could go to the airport and put it through the screener . there is a little tag on the case that reads dx6490 but it obviously is not since the size is incorrect in height , depth and width and my number does not appear on their invoice . when i checked kodak online , the dimensions for my camera case were larger in all three dimensions . amazon is attempting to resolve the matter but as yet have no feed back from them either . at this point i would never patronize antoline again	1
yes , i have to agree with the previous review . it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources . it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything . if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much , and just chalk it up to extra protection . but that seems to be all it 's good for	1

i personally have not taken this diet pill ; however i am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt " trippy " " weird " and " out of sorts " . britney spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all " postal " , shaved her head , attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and did n't return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm.. . none the less , the side effects like those reported i 've seen personally from close friends . they should re-name this diet pill asylum-x , because that 's where you 'll be . diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids , and i do n't know about you but i 'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to " swallow "	3
i bought this from ioniczone themselves . it does not work . i kept it on for an entire month , the filter was never dirty at all . also , this unit is extremely small , the pic is rather misleading i was however able to return the unit to the office in nv , had to make 2 phone calls and the person was very polite . i went on to buy one from ionicpro , and what a difference it was , filters requires cleaning every 10 days or so and it was really dirty .	3

this is , without question , the worst book ever written on one 's financial life . to begin with , it 's useless : zero information , zero new analysis of old information , zero advice , zero interesting anecdotes . additionally , it 's rambling- -meandering from summaries of old data , to poorly written schmaltzy ' new age ' feel-good blathering . what exactly is this guy 's point ? no way to tell . seriously , this book is so bad that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have , in my opinion , lost all remaining credibility . what a waste of my $16 and 4 hours . i want my money and time back .	0

ms put office 2007 on a dvd rather than a cd so there is only one disk , so they make the installation easier right off the bat . unlike all previous versions of office , you do not have to get into the details of what options you want . in previous versions , if you did n't make sure you installed all the features , when you went to do a function that was n't installed , you had to dig out your office disks and install the feature . a huge pain , but not anymore . the installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of office . you do n't have to tell it manually where to find your files . you do n't have to manually put in your favorite buttons . it 's all done for you . yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions , but once you figure them out , it is so nice and smooth . this version is light years better than all previous versions . the most impressive part of the installation is outlook 2007. in all previous versions , you had to export and import all your files and contacts . anyone who experienced this , knows that it never went that smooth . sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and contacts in the transfer , and the time it took to do this , was very painful . this is not the case with outlook 2007. just load the program and it does all the transfers from your previous version of outlook . you do n't have to do a thing , and you 're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading . you will be shocked how simple it is . anything new has it 's growing pains to learn , but once you do , you will be very glad you made the change	5
this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front . across the region known as flanders , three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains . this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed . it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians , the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling , bombing , machine gun fire , gas attacks and wretched weather conditions . in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down . it is a shame so many historians , including such military writers as david glantz , do not emulate groom 's style	0
" st. elmo 's fire " is one of those movies that could have been better , should have been better and yet , it just wasn't . it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s , the so-called brat pack ( well , everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall , who were spared this misstep ) . maybe this was supposed to be " the breakfast club - - after college " , but while " the breakfast club " had characters , even stereotypical characters , that you could relate to , there is absolutely no one , with the exception of emilio estevez ' character , that you care enough about to relate to in this film . the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois , but georgetown , where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college . uh-huh . yeah , right . judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is , nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy , in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that . andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy ( or maybe it 's just the pearls ? ) emilio estevez is a future attorney , working as a waiter / server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell . mare winningham is a dowdy , trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity , working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her . she instead fantasizes about rob lowe , who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band , who has dropped out of school , married a white trash-y looking groupie , had a child with her and has now separated from her , and taking up with other groupies . demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking , has a serious coke problem , stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol . sounds promising , huh ? well , in what is an early portend of the " melrose place " to come , sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is , dumps his ass , immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy , who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job ; estevez , after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there , travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her . he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed , he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home . lowe , in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere , takes winningham 's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus . moore , after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother , has all her furnishings repossessed , loses her job and freaks out . not exactly " the breakfast club " . the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves . with the exception of estevez ' character , they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped . their every action , every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional . their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that . winningham 's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy , knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was . and yet , she still gave her virginity to him . maybe if winningham was n't so bright , or she was a college freshman , it would be understandable . but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent . lowe really had little to do with his role . maybe if he had played the role nelson had - - as the roving lothario , with sheedy waiting at home , it might have gone over better . with his too-pretty looks , it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him . nelson just does n't seem comfortable and does n't pull it off - -but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player . moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems , mirroring her character - - but was later rehired . while the title song later become a minor hit , " st. elmo 's fire " itself missed the mark .	2
this pedometer is so much cheaper ( ~$7 ) than the typical decent ones ( that go for about $18 - $20 ) .. now i know it is for a reason. . the buttons are flimsy , the package looks very cheap , the one i bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work , also found that the sr citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device. . terrible ergonomics / form factor . would recommend spending a bit more and getting the omron / oregon sc $18 pedometers - much better form factor , high reliability and quality	3
this was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they did n't have it at the best buy i went to . i like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip . most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot . all like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein , afterhours , foot prints , i left my wallet in el segundo , bonita applebum , can i kick it , rhythm , go ahead in the rain , and description of a fool . man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable . i wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd . the only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs . this is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics .	4
caine 's book is by far the most practical book on acting i 've read , and i 've read a few . some are very beautifuly written , poetic and psychological , but for someone who really wants to learn something about acting for film , i would recommend this book first . it is at times bleakly honest but highly readable . if you 've done any acting , you 'll find yourself nodding frequently	0
this cd is the worst " comedy " cd i have ever heard . yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious ? ? ? ? ok , i 've come to the conclusion , the only people writing positive reviews on amazon must be the people trying to sell the junk . i 've seen this guy on some tv shows , and on comedy central , and he 's a somewhat funny guy , but it is painful to listen to this cd . you can feel the awkwardness of the crowd , not knowing if or when to laugh . and it continues throughout the entire cd . there do n't seem to be any jokes on the cd at all . it is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being . do n't believe me ? then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk , and see for yourself . like my review title says , do not read the positive reviews . just read the negative ones , and decide how credible they seem . then make your decision to buy or not buy	4
the daughter of a prominent boston doctor is dead , apparently from a botched abortion ( which was illegal in the late 60 's ) . dr. john berry 's friend , art lee , is in jail for the crime , which he says he did n't commit . so , dr. berry sets out to prove his friend 's innocence , and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets . but there are many doubts , such as was the girl really pregnant , and did dr. lee actually perform the surgery , and why is dr. berry so interested in finding the culprit ? for michael crichton 's first novel , it 's not bad , but nowhere near as good as some later ones . the plot is marginally interesting , but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog did n't sound very natural . dr. berry ( who just takes the whole work week off to investigate ) talks more like a cheesy " private eye " than a doctor . also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up	0

the story here dose n't matter . the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending . scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction , meth . quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless . roberts is so gay you want to smack his face . he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity . rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius , a role he plays better than anyone today in film . br	2

this is a nearly verbatim rendition of the grimms ' story , and it 's hard to understand why zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children . even harder to figure out is how the american library association could award its caldecott medal for distinguished american picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale : the king threatens to kill the miller 's daughter if she ca n't spin gold from straw . rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her , but extracts a necklace , a ring and , on the third night of spinning , a promise of her firstborn . she then marries the king , whom zelinsky depicts as young and handsome . when it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn , rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name . she sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name . so the king , though he looks good , is greedy and brutal . the queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life , and then depends on an anonymous , unrecognized " servant girl " to save the child . and rumpelstiltskin , shown as physically unattractive and ( the message seems to be ) therefore bad , is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for . a weird , twisted story that offers nothing for kids , illustrated with renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad	0

" even though it has been out since 1998 , the last year i was single myself . where have i been , and why had n't i seen this book ? susan page writes for " involuntary singles " - - straight , gay , male or female , each and every one of us who is single and wishes we weren't . relentlessly positive , she starts off right to the point with " so why are you still single anyway ? " and then , just when we 've gotten over that shock , she states flatly : " whatever your reasons are for being single , if you want to be in a relationship , no reason is good enough . " then page goes about tearing apart every good reason we 've ever come up with to keep ourselves single . here 's what page takes on and turns around : ambivalence ( my favorite ) , those " dreadful statistics , " the myth of " there are no good ways to meet people , " and having and keeping high standards . then she works on developing skills in what she calls " frog kissing " : learning to say no , how to recognize true intimacy , avoiding " commitmentphobes , " handling the intimacy gap , and learning to say " yes . " and in the last section , " keeping it all together while you look , " page tells you just how to do all that . this is easily the best , most thorough , rounded and positive book about relationships and dating i have seen . if you are one of page 's " involuntary singles , " this book needs to be in your library . five chocolate dipped strawberries for susan page ! this is quite a book .	0
i originally bought the edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but was looking for a separate bag in which to keep the cables that are not used often ( to leave at home ) . then i came across the edit 120+ with the detachable case which fit the bill exactly . not haven actually seen the detachable bag yet , i was somewhat concerned about the method / design of the atachment . it needed to be easy to remove , but it also needed to be secure ; the pictures i found on the internet did n't show how it was attached . i was relieved when i actually saw how it was attached . there is a slotted bottom on the main bag the entire length of the bag ( an open slot is at each end ) . the add-on bag has a wide semi-rigid flap that slides through the slotted bottom and a fold down tab on the free end that is secured by velcro . the attachment method is secure and is almost invisable , and the design compliments the aesthetics of the original bag . i think the original bag is very good , and the add-on detachable bag makes this a superb choice . unfortunately , you have to buy this as a combination . if you originally bought the 120 single bag version , it does n't have the slotted bottom on it and ca n't be retrofitted ( and i do n't think they sell the detachable bag separately )	1
i was having a problem with over-eating and eating when i was n't hungry and as a result , gained quite a bit of weight , and felt awful . i 've only been using this product for three days , but already my portion size has shrunk immensely and my energy is way up . i have n't felt jittery or shaky . i feel better than i have in months . i would recommend this to those who also have problems with cravings or portion size and want to drop some un-needed weight	3
i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it . the quality of the pictures is very poor , showing large grain , even at shq and low iso settings . no combination of settings seems to improve quality	1
i bought this camera for its great price , good reviews , and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter . i returned the camera after three weeks , however , due to abysmal low light performance among other things . the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child . i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor / delivery and follow up . unfortunately , when we returned home to view our footage , much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes . the camera does include a light and a magicpix option , but unless you 're using a tripod , you 're bound to end up with a strobe-light effect ( perfect for recreating " thriller music videos , " but not much help otherwise . ) i also found the image quality with the gs31 to be fairly lackluster and pixilated . granted , you get what you pay for , but i was really taken aback that my 1992 camcorder shot much better footage . that being said , the camera did a lot better in good / outdoor lighting ( albeit still somewhat pixilated ) , and the zoom is incredible . the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated . in the end , i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment ( ... ) i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout . also , if you do buy this camera , make sure to buy the dv cable ( firewire for macs ) through amazon or some other online retailer .

the author makes a couple of valuable points . first , any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent " secular " ( i.e. , indefinitely long ) bear markets . most leading investment advisors recommend a " buy and hold " strategy , but this only works during predominately bull market periods . most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market , which is anomalous in historical terms . the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that " buy and hold " does n't always provide the best returns . obviously , then , it 's better to pull out during the bear markets , but that 's easier said than done . the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets , including p / e ratio , interest and inflation rates , and gdp . the problem is that those characteristics do n't always correlate with market performance . for example , this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market . well , if you heeded his advice , you would have missed the bull market of 2004 , 2005 and early 2006 , especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks . even with high p / e ratios , a bull market can continue for several years : witness the late 90s . it 's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis . there is so much volatility on a daily , weekly , monthly , and yearly basis that 's it 's impossible to know when the market has switched directions . by the time that it is apparent , it 's too late to profit . even in the midst of great bull markets , there might be week , month , or even year-long downturns . the author says nothing about individual stock picking , beyond a general value approach . the book is all about big picture , long term trends . another problem is that the author 's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. but the market ( and economy ) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s , 50s , 60s , and 70s . as they say , past performance does not predict future returns . the investment advice provided here is not useful . he suggests a " portfolio of hedge funds , " ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k . he also recommends a " bond ladder , " an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund , and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations . i do n't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that ! one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility , which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations . volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for . most studies just average the returns across years , but that does n't reflect real returns . let 's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second . your average return should be 10% a year , right ? wrong . at the end of the first year you have 135k . minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total , equal to 7% a year compounded . if you had received 10% a year compounded , your final total would be over 121k . that 's 6k difference in just 2 years , and the volatility costs add up . the book is very poorly written , plodding , sooooo boring , with tons of repetition . just as an example , the graph showing the " y curve " relationship between p / e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times .	0
holly played by kristen miller ( she spies , man of the year ) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by brooke burns ( baywatch , death of the supermodels ) . the 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named zucas ( i think thats close enough ) runned by actor tod babcock ( guard dogs , poor white trash ) . when holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with mr. babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate tess , played by allison lange ( the hillside strangler , roswell ) . holly becomes close to tess and they seem to hit it off real well , until holly finds out some things about tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea . well , in 1992 , jennifer jason leigh did this to bridget fonda and now they make a sequel about it , wow , they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one . pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great . this can go down with basic instinct 2....in the trash can or the skeet shoot , one of the two . also starring francois giroday ( carpool guy , framed ) , tracey mccall ( not another teen movie , second degree ) , rif hutton ( osmosis jones , halfway decent ) and kyme ( school daze , geppetto ) .	2

this is my first and very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i have used canon point and shoot digital camera previously . i was avoiding dslr 's because i used to rarely use my eos film slr . the convienience of a point and shoot from that experience was overwhelming . unfortunately so are it 's limitations . so back i came , and the only choice though expensive was the eos 5d for it 's full frame sensor ! the pain was reduced by the double rebates . wow ! this is a revelation ! beautifull images , lot of control . i did notice that the af was not as fast as my old elan iie . i was also disappointed that for the price there was a lack of weather sealing . i am not happy with canon for this , but i really appreciate them for making a full frame sensor in a difficult marketable slot as far as their line up was concerned . this camera also needs prime or l lenses , because the sensor will reveal the inadequacies of inferior lenses . this add 's to the cost . this is an exceptional photographic tool that i hope to use to improve my skill as i explore all it 's capabilities	1
on our beloved kay scarpetta and the illustrious ms. cornwell ? having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning , i simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff ? very slow in the beginning , i began to fear a repeat of the struggle that i endured to finish blowfly . however , this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through , and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted . the storyline finds scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...richmond , virginia , where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl . so scarpetta- --with marino tagging along of course- --heads back to richmond from her new home in florida to offer assistance ; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one , under the leadership of dr. joel marcus , is sloppy regarding policies and procedures . the demoralization of her former staff by dr. marcus is also unnerving to scarpetta ; and clearly he resents her intrusion . so why has he asked her to come ? meanwhile , lucy , as head of the last precinct , is once again up to her ears in nonsense . for such a brilliant , successful young woman ( as readers have always been lead to believe ) , why must cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life ? in this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee . worse than the weak storyline , and the fact that this novel is just all over the place , is the author 's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of african-americans throughout . drug dealers are black , they 're dead of gunshot wounds , and most ludicrous of all is in one instance cornwell references a dead young man 's " conspicuously large organ . " are you kidding me ? the trash collectors are " big dark men " and of course in an upscale neighborhood , the " old black woman " must work in one of the houses . the author 's unbelievably narrow-minded , stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best , and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as lucy . read only if you must , but frankly there are better ways to spend your time . dy	0
i just got a 2006 version of math blasters , i played it for a while and i thought that it was really frustrating and it didnt help me at math at all ! i think that anyone who plays it will probably fall right to sleep when they start playing ! the box it came in said it was for age 6-12 but i think it is for 6 or 7 year old kids . i really dont think this is a good game to play	5
sorry sleepmd - we are not impressed . not only did sleepmd not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too . today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off . no - i did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed . more like we were run over during the night . i wanted to inquire to the company in person - but ca n't find a website to do so . so i plan to write . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it 's a waste of money	3
i have pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble . the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution . they 're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you 're done . i hate that i 'm consuming a product that is so disposable , but at the same time , it works so well	3
the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them , and i could not get the hooks to work . i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it , and it failed . far short of the maximum weight on the package . in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics . the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures , which i had to hang with other hardware	3
i bought one and it worked great . at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot , and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot , but once you get used to it , it does a stellar job of straightening your hair . around 6 months into using the straightner , the machine slowly overheated and died . thinking i had a faulty model , i went out and bought a new one . guess what ? a few months into that one , it ended the same way . so basically , not worth it .	3
these are hands down , the most awesome pillows , we have ever owned . they were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow , however at the time , a " water bed pillow " for $60 just sounded silly . what brought me back around to these pillows , was the year-long search that my wife and i had been on for the perfect pillows . one of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows , which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow . we spent a year , buying this pillow and that pillow , all to no avail . then one day i rolled the dice , and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers . the covers actually make the dish . these are the most comfortable pillows that i have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet ! ! ! these pillows rate 10 stars ! ! ! just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had . i do not work for , nor own this company , although after using their product i wish i did ! ! ! our pillows are about three months old so far , and holding up exceptionally well . they recommend you change the water every six months or so , depending on what type of water you put in . the pillow is about half to three quarters cushion , with the water being the bottom layer . they seal tight and do not leak . there is no audible sound from the water in the pillow , as if you follow the directions , they will instruct you on how to expel excess air . these pillows and of those black & decker scissors , have to be my two best finds for 2006 ! !	3
i 've been listening to satoshi tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best cd 's yet . its one of those cd 's that is a must have before a road trip . just play it and let it ride . from beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit . before you know it your at the end , but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again .	4
if you are looking for a still shot digital camera ok. . but why buy this monster for that ? i have a t1 that does the trick there and gives 5mp . ok , so maybe video ? ok , but then why do i want a dvd with nothing but raw footage ? cant edit it without a lot of work . ( where is the firewire port , or even the ability to edit an mpg file ? ) geeez. . anyway. . i am taking mine back . it is totally useless to me as i already have a still shot camera. . save your money. . dont do it. .	1

i 've been following the alex cross series from its beginning , and after reading cat & mouse , i 'm wondering if patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go.. . given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more cross books written subsequently to this one , i can only hope that the series gets better . my complains are similar to those of other reviewers : 1. i 'm getting sick of the perfection of alex cross . the man 's a saintly father , saintly grandson , saintly lover , saintly charity worker , and saintly detective . these traits hooked the reader and made cross an intriguing character , but he 's fast becoming too one-dimensional . 2. the cross / sampson relationship . as if we were n't sick enough of this already . every few chapters , we 're reminded of the man-crush cross and sampson have on each other . sampson is so perfect in cross 's eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time sampson enters a scene . 3. the cross / christine johnson relationship moves way too fast . one moment christine is still mourning the loss of her husband ( who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in jack & jill ) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date , and the next she and cross are madly in love . no development whatsoever , no line from point a to point b . 4. i 'm not sure patterson could have written the dialogue between cross and his children any more unrealistically . are n't these 7 - and 9-year-old children ? he has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with sampson or kyle craig . 5. the entire novel is a series of pseudo-climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field . the soneji resolution was anti-climactic at best , and the mr. smith conclusion was unfulfilling	0
simple . it loads like a blaze . sure all the new frills and features like easy annotations are neat , but the speed of 7.0 alone makes it worth every dime . especially if your current acrobat is the half-baked clunky 6.0.x that burst through the gates before it had legs .	5
i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e. same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product	1
wow ! what more can i say ! just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience . this is a " behind the scenes " look at photography . it gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the " shot of a lifetime " . i own many national geographic books , but you wo n't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this dvd . even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it	2

the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival . the author obviously knows his stuff . what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published . i 'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j.l. bourne a deal . he 's good	0
this has been a good purchase for us . we are in northern italy for about 7 weeks , and needed to navigate a number of cities : for several business meetings and just to find our way around . it has been an invaluable tool . we have still used physical maps to a certain extent , but in finding the shortest routes , and other points of interest , this has helped us never to be lost ( so far !	5
i gave this a good listen , but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable	4
this frame looks great until you turn it on . the picture quality is less than stellar , but that is n't what annoyed me about this frame . when you buy this frame do n't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program . what does that mean you ask ? that means that your photos wo n't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode . you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images ; this will not take advantage of the entire frame . if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame , making peoples faces distorted . i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation . see below . the build quality of the frame is pretty good . if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen , this would be a nice little frame . a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches the image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal . i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse . you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image . some of your images might be better served one at a time . start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program . 1. go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% ( or 788 pixels ) this will make the image look distorted . that is ok . 2. then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% ( or 591 pixels ) the image is ready to save . you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed . 3. copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame	1
i just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song . thanks to melania for pointing out the song title at the end . i realize this cd is just a soundtrack , but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs . it is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this cd . my vote - do not buy this cd . the soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff . but get the ending title song if you can - it 's great .	4

i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework , and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds . the one i purchased was flawed , and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up . when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures . what the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable - so it does not hook up to a computer . this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera , or that you must have / purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card . ( a side note - if you have a sony digital camera , memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent , you took with another camera , or you reformatted with a photo program ) . i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead - far better quality , and much more user friendly	1
i do n't know why most of the reviews are so negative . mine works perfectly , it does not flip-flop , does not drop down and you can remove those thingies inside to make the water pressure higher for a more soothing shower experience . reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have what is called a " diverter valve " attached to my shower head . the waterpik is meant to be installed directly onto the shower head itself . i could not do that , because i have a portable " wand " that is moveable via hose connected to the valve and noticed that the threading is too short for the waterpik to latch on to . went to home depot and got an extension and a coupling , kind of ingenious and used lots of pipe tape to " interface " the waterpik via the extension , via the coupling onto the diverter valve.... . wow ! no leaks ! works perfectly . for those of you out there that has a diverter valve for more then one showerhead option , go to home depot , lowe 's or a hardware store and what i wrote above will work as it did for me . enjoy	3
this is one of the four cameras , the only digital camera , i used to learn portrait photography . the class was on how to take portraits not how to use the camera . i wanted to graduate from the point and shoot but had to consider my budget because i wanted an slr film camera also . i got the canon rebel ti packed with two lenses . it made sense to me to purchase a canon digital to interchange lenses . my original choice was the canon digital rebel , however , in my web search , i found the eos 10d for $750 with no catch . there were no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me to spend the extra money i would have spent on the camera on accessories . since it 's digital , i am not shy about trying out the features . when i first got the camera , some of the photos were dark or very light . after tinkering around and learning what the sensor-indicators means i do n't get that anymore . the 10d is more camera than i need that i 'm sure i will have it for a long time .	1
it 's easy to use and makes good pictures , easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait . i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures . as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e-mail	1
michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana . this record is her first with friend jessica harp . the ladies mine the borderline between the singer / songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format . highlights include the opening track leave the pieces , way back home , the good kind , and the title track stand still look pretty . of special note is the presence of producer / multi-instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks . i recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't sound like formula country	4

lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale " vibrating " using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough " vibration " to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .	3
a lot of very useful info in a small book . i 'm less than half the way through and i 've already learned enough to make it worth the investment to me . the chapter on using tables was just what i needed . i would recommend this book to other beginners who are still trying to make sense of it all	0
this is n't what i thought it would be . the instructions are unclear , so i had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it . i finally figured it out after about 10 minutes of fiddling with it . you have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out - so it takes two hands . that means that once you put gel on your face , you get gel on the machine . i set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm . this must be a safety thing , but i ca n't imagine what the lower settings are for . the gel cools extremely fast , so by the time you apply it to your face , only the gel where you first apply it feels warm . i had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better , but i do n't use foam shaving creme anymore . once i use up this can of gel , the hot gel machine gets retired .	3
this mirror is unsatisfactory becasue the light is negligible and the magnification ( 5x ) is not sufficient	3
i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book , but it 's not as bad as i remembered . some episodes are actually incredibly funny . the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie , and have her come between joey and ross . also , the whole story line with rachel 's infatuation for joey could 've been better executed , or should n't have been there at all . it got bad towards the end , but i 'm not disappointed . the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends	2
i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject . there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title . i read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group .	0
i cannot address the value of buying products from this manufacturer ; that 's for you to decide . however , this product performs noticably worse than its earth-unfriendly alternatives . clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with tide , the other one i use . but the decision is yours	3
great camera for the price . but i guess you get what you pay for , bad warranty.......... .	1
this is still the best one out there , but this new version ( been getting yearly updates since 1998 ) adds very little . finally updated a couple streets in our area , so that alone was worth it	5
to be honest i ca n't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i 've heard . for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time , never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one . my favourite songs on the album are " the only moment we were alone " and " six days at the bottom of the ocean " every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i 'm am fixated on nothing else but them . i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently . this album is not as experimental as " those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever " but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well , with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be . i love the pure , clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind . the trance that this album provides is indescribable ; i 'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note . either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase , for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced , written , recorded , thought out and sounding . buy it , you will not regret your choice one bit .	4
this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix . it turns them a light shade of grey , maybe . it is horrible . this to me renders it useless . it is for the most basic of users . there are no real manual functions to speak of , and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it . it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly , i would say do not buy . seller was great , product is poor .	5

this is a good compilation of afi 's songs over the 10+ years they 've been together . it 's easily worthy of 10 stars . this cd allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to sing the sorrow , and to get more intimate with the band . i hav n't purchased this album yet , because i already have all their albums , but plan on it . the new tracks are from the answer that , and very proud of ya era . they 've finally been released on cd . this is a cool little feature fo newcomers also . anyway , buy this album only if you hav n't heard any of afis music but want to give it a try	4
it cost a little more , but it 's worth it . it keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare	3
you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very " messy " system . but it does have a great antivirus and firewall , and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on " behind the scenes " , it 's an okay product . but be very careful with the cleanup tool . it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	5

i was so disappointed in this film . the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting . i love terrance , he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing . he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye . call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis , tennessee in this day and time ? and did terrance howard give ludacris ' character a cassette tape to listen to ? not a cd , a tape . i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too . and the hook to that song , " you know it 's hard out here for a pimp . " ya think ? with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all . i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed . do n't get me wrong , i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just do n't quite bring it , do we ? " the cookout " " how high ? " " girl 6 " " woo " " kingdom come " now we can add " hustle and flow " to the list . i 'm glad terrance howard redeemed himself in " crash . " do yourself a favor and pass on this one .	2
please be aware of this camera 's shock sensitivity i was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the second time . it 's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world . the result is it loses it 's ability to focus and zoom . it did n't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket , with the lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly . the first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . the second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that 's more than 1 / 3 the original purchase price . i wo n't reinvest in a weak product . i 'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether	1

this book is a rare but insightful look into the practice of one of the new urbanist legends . uda began the pattern book revival a decade ago ( and also has a book out describing the process of writing one . ) they also are one of the pioneers of the new urbanist revolution , which , by discarding the fictions of modernist planning , have rediscovered existing methods and have discovered new methods of creating compact , mixed-use and walkable neighborhoods that were always the basic cellular structure of cities from the dawn of time until just before world war ii . we have understood the basic principles again for some time . what this book shows are some of the mechanics of how to do it again	0

at christmas 2003 i was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me . it worked as advertised for about six months . then it displayed the err message more and more . we replaced the battery . then it would not permit any function buttons to perform . we just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale . when it went completely blank this week , battery of no use , i hopped on the internet to see what anyone else 's experience is . to be fair , i will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right . i hope they can . if not , i will see what the weight watchers scales is like . sigh ...	3
first off , for people who are complaining about installing windows 2000 , it only took my approx . 6 1 / 2 hours ! i love it because every time i launch internet explorer it freezes ! i also love that theres 42 spyware programs and 78 tojans on my harddrive before i even hooked up my internet . the one thing i love the most though is that i can download any movie i want . like the recently video game adapted film mortal kombat ! it was at full quality on my 28.8k modem and it took about 3 minutes . the blue sceen of death happens so often i just went ahead and set it as my desktop and my screensaver . i also bought the separate ctrl alt del accesory pad , ive had it for about 2 days and i cant even tell what key is what anymore because i 've used it so much . but all in all dos has been a blessing , and i hope everyone embraces windows 95 into their homes . - shanan	5
firstly , i have not seen the film adaptation of ' single white female ' and so this review is n't tainted one way or the other . this book , about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate , is written is very easy style . characterizations , prose , and dialogue are all straightforward . i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel . and the book 's " feel " is anything but original . ' sliver ' by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life ( and danger ) in manhattan for a single , white female . still , ' single white female ' is an entertaining read . bottom line : a very enjoyable , suspenseful read that does n't tax the brain . recommended	0
the show is absolutely great ! blue falcon is another space ghost and dynomut is the futuristic version of scooby doo . dim witted and loveable . getting the complete show is great and the shows from these hb vaults are all looking pretty good with bright and vivid colors ( amid some nasty scratches and dust , but it was cheap animation folks ) . as a scooby fan this is a must own ! i quite enjoy the blue falcon / dynomut show also . 5 stars for the show . the set however nice still drops the ball , you get two single sided dvds and two flippers . the problem with this is that the dvds are all on top of each other with maybe a 1 / 16th of an inch between them both . i know this was to cut down on costs but it makes the two flipper discs quite hard to get out without scratching them or marking them up with a good fingerprint smear . but then again if it was a perfect world we could n't complain . all in all a solid set ! 4 1 / 2 out of 5	2
no reviews available pre-purchase . set was totally useless . laughably out-of-date . poor color . two disks had flasws at the ends . i wanted to use them for a bible study group , but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash . the cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort . - - zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted . - - i exopected better of amazon	2
acrobat 5 was so buggy that i thought i 'd give adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading . should have waited longer . there have been improvements in v7 : a better look , better commenting , the ability to add text that actually prints , and far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions are way worse than in v5 : some word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7 , seems to be something to do with font license issues . installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs , clashes with standard security software , and endless errors in the automatic update feature . the new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone . despite my already low expectations of adobe , this product is a disappointment . with acrobat 7 , adobe is , as usual , charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version . ( for reference , my system is window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5gb ram )	5

since " er " debuted on nbc in 1994 , it 's taken the nation by storm . it 's wonderfully produced by author michael chricton , a former surgeon before his writing career . for numerous years , it was the #1 drama series on television . the show starts with the cast of anthony edwards ( mark greene ) , george clooney ( doug ross ) , sherry stringfield ( susan lewis ) , noah wyle ( john carter ) , julianna margulies ( carol hathaway ) , and eriq la salle ( peter benton ) . it has since won and been nominated for several awards including emmys . its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode . its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes . season one introduces the everyday life in the er in chicago . throughout , it explores many critical issues including hathaway 's self-destruction that results in a suicide attempt , carter struggling as a medical student , ross living his sex obsessed life , and others . regular show viewers who have n't seen season one will see part of lewis 's reason for leaving chicago in 1996 , greene in his first marriage and before ella 's birth ( mother is corday , who began in 1997 ) , deb chin 's ( played by ming na ) brief time in that er as a medical student before returning as an official doctor in 2000 , and many others . such combination shows partially how the show 's theme evolved to today . episode by episode , the plot 's quality stays on top . the overall scenery , through the physical environment to the emotional drama , never fails to compile the unforgettable viewing experience . season two features the debuts of gloria reuben ( jeanie boulet ) and laura innes ( kerry weaver , not an official cast member until season 3 ) . this season explores ross 's most heroic act as a doctor , carter becoming a doctor , lewis being forced to care for her neice , and many more . today 's viewers who have n't seen season two will witness boulet before testing positive for hiv , weaver before realizing her lesbianism , hathaway before her today 's happy life ( though now in seattle ) , and others . this plot evolves very well in quality from the previous season . it continues its run of staying on top in critical care and drama . both seasons feature wonderful acting from the entire cast . all add their own sense of individual theme into every scene . through personal struggles , drama , and continually saving lives , everyone gives the show its unique viewing flavor . such show quality makes " er - the complete first two seasons " worthy for all fans . this is sure to please its audiences . new viewers should watch these two seasons first . otherwise , the plot will be confusing . fans should watch for season 3 to be released on video in the near future	2
do you feel different from people around you ? do they resent your ingenuity ? have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs ? do you long for the company of others like yourself , who , tragically but inevitably , are biologically destined to wipe these shorter , darker subhumans from the face of the earth ? congratulations ! you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club , possibly both ! ( i exaggerate - you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia , or a boer in south africa , or maybe you just like larry niven , but that 's beside the point ) i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book . in the late 1970 's when she did her research , we did n't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals , and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia . ultimately we 'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like , and auel 's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion . similarly , her bloated , almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author , though one wonders what parasite infected her editor . i have n't read her more recent works , but i imagine she has probably improved . even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable . what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story , nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged . the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky 's secret doctrine on the fall of the " aryans " - who interbred with " subhumans " introducing the world to , oh i dunno , domination by the unworthy , blind tradition , suppression of the individual , all the hallmarks of the book 's neanderthal culture . of course , even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent , overpowered by a brutish thug . against this master narrative , all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression . i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet , and give auel 's books a wide berth . also ? enough rape scenes already	0
got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during christmas 2005. camera is easy to use and takes good pictures . easily interfaces with pc through usb . however , i also ( as did another reviewer ) started having problems after about 11 months . camera would not take pictures as the ccd went bad . luckily i had an extended service contract and it was repaired . unfortunately , it just quit working again ( april 2007 ) and the service contract company says they " ...wo n't bother fixing it again.. . " and is refunding my purchase price . gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time . good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract	1
this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion . it is not a manual nor a guide . no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book . the style is simbolic and poetical . it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content . it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work	0
hp is selling this bag for $30 bucks , so when i found it here for $10 less i could n't let this " deal " pass me by.. . however when i received the bag , i wished i had.. . the color is less vibrant , it 's cheap , poor quality , plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag.. . walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead , it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
i am not a professional photographer . i just happen to be a grandson of one . i use a fully manual canon tx slr for my work . so far i 've shot 5 rolls of this stuff . every time there has been something wrong with the camera / me / lighting . every time i got a usable , and sometimes , great print . this film has a huge exposure latitute ( you can really screw up and still get an image ) when i show these prints to others , they look at me funny and say , & quot ; this is iso 400 ? & quot ; it has really fine grain . and because it 's iso 400 , you can use it for almost anything ( i got usable prints after shooting a soccer game : my camera was set at iso 100 and there were light leaks in the camera door ) . it 's a great film , although i 'm told the royal gold it replaces is still better . pick up a pack of this and see what you get . you 'll be amazed	1
the one song i know is a remake is " goodnight my love . " i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake . but the others with which i 'm familiar - but do n't have original vinyl to compare , only memories - seem authentic . the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re-recordings of old vinyl or cassettes .	4
eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work ( osd ) and academia ( naval war college and harvard ) . i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work . i was disappointed . i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals . he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold . i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way . the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal , but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts . the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work . the churchill chapter was the best . cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill . his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done , thought not rally tied to the focus of the book . i learned the most from the ben-gurion , since i knew the least about him . the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy , but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest .	0
do n't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good . traffic ur adagio for strings nyana those songs are just great and the best off the album . but songs like walking on clouds sweet misery love comes again forever today can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though . no song here is annoying in the beginning and i see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for dj tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it . cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff . dj tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 dj i expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying verdict : 2.8 out of 5.0 not bad for the first 20 listens but damn i could have enjoyed it much more	4
this hair dryer is truly a professional , salon type dryer . many dryers are advertised as such , but this one lives up to that reputation . very sleek , beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature . this was a surprise ( turbo ) which i 'm enjoying , coupled with the smooth and strong drying . the sound is even pleasant , not too loud , and it works quickly .

before you get all worked up , let me say that he has a voice , but he really does n't have a style . he sings songs way too straight , he makes even bobby short sound like an improviser ! he also does n't seem to be in touch with his masculine side , his vocie is very , well if ying is male , and yang is female , he sounds very yang . he needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he wo n't sound so obnoxious , then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying ( masculine side ) in his voice . he needs to hear a few billy eckstine lp's . i do n't think he can change but here 's hoping he 'll take my advice . as far as you buying this cd it is your decision , this is just my honest opinion	4
ms milton admits to her anger at humanistic psychology , so she attacks without understanding . she does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people 's work she denigrates . maslow 's hierarchy of needs is one example . i have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings . i have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with carl rogers , and william coulson as instructors . any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job ms milton did presenting them . she should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book . her bias is extreme and obvious . so consider this when reading the book . no doubt ms milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs . i am sure pat robinson and jerry falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology	0

i bought two of these pieces of junk , and believe me they do not work unless your room is about 3 feet by 3 feet by 3 feet . it recirculates the same air over and over in a tiny area ! when they say it cleans 700 cubic feet per hour , that is simply what the fan can move per hour not what it actually will clean in a 10 foot by 10 foot by 7 foot room . the fan is so weak at full speed you can barely feel it . really it is sucking in air through the bottom and blowing it out at the top . both the inlet and outlet are facing the same side so you are basically recirculating most of the same air over and over again . this thing would need to be 7 feet tall to really work well . in a hospital they have huge systems that move the air past larger arrays of bulbs . so here you are sitting in a room with your kids coughing on one side and this thing recirculating the same air over and over again , in a little tiny airspace , what a great deal . just be ready to buy 10 of them per room . maybe you can try hanging 5 on the celiing and putting 5 on the floor of a 4 ' x5 ' bathroom and it might work in a week . do yourself a favor , and buy a machine that has more uv light bulbs , and has a greater airflow so all the air in a room is moving and all of the air in the room goes through the filter . i gave it a one because it looks nifty .	3
i loved the x-men cartoon in the 90s and fox , and always liked reading the graphic novels in barnes and noble and the like . however , i just never had the time or money to get into it like i wanted . this collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years . reading the first 60 issues was a trip - - seeing how the characters were developed , both the art and their literary personality . if you 're interested in the x-men , whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart - - for 40 bucks you can know it all .

the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd , the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars . this set was poorly put together , the shorts included are quite random , and buying this set would be a waste of money . each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters . first there is alfalfa , then buckwheat , spanky , darla , porky , mickey , stymie , then fatty - oh wait , no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name , then farina , and last phil macmahon - who you may be asking ? phil macmahon , the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938. still do n't know him ? maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection . disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day . dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot ; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series . however , it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score . derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series . it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races . the films themselves are very good . disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright . it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents . it is a total disaster . just like in reunion in rhythm , one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry . the film has been seriously cut ; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length . the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted . the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores , but it works . there are sound effects too . sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train . it is a very cute film ; farina is especially funny in it . the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood . the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks . the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers . it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship . when it sinks , they find a real one to destroy . this short has also been cut ; there is no opener for it either . it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it . disk three opens with mary queen of tots . it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang . she dreams they come to life , and when she wakes up , she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life . this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set . it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though . the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters . the print on this one is not bad at all . the last film is school 's out , a talkie featuring a different cast . it is a film featuring miss crabtree , the new teacher . the picture is good ; it seems to be the one from cabin fever . disk four begins with bear shooters . this is a less than great film . the print is great ; it is the one from cabin fever . our gang follies of 1938 is a great film , very funny , long , and exciting . it features the later talkie cast . waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years , a lesser film that seems forced . it was also released in a 5 part rascals set . disk five is the extra features dvd . it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show . on it , some of the silent gang are reunited . joe cobb , jackie condon , farina hoskins , johnny downs , and mickey daniels are featured . the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview . other child stars like jackie coogan , judy garland , shirley temple , roddy mcdowall , and ron howard are focused on as well . the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain . many of them have been available cheaply for years . the only reason a fan might want to see this collection , the same reason i bothered , was to see the rarer silent films . however , the rest of the set is trash	2

i really enjoyed this book , it was n't completely comprehensive but did give a good overview of buffet 's investment style . while it did n't go heavily into the analysis of stocks that i would have liked it did describe who influenced buffet , thanks to this book i was able to pick up some fisher and graham and have learned quite a bit . all in all i would reccomend this book for someone interested in a light biography of buffet or a little insight into how he makes decisions	0
i did n't give this five stars because it 's some kind of oscar-worthy achievement , but if you are a fan of the quirky , b-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties , then this film is a must . " hawk " offers hilarious jump-cut editing , dialogue that is spectacular in its badness , and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film . for all that , the film is also remarkable for its innocence , in a time when cheesecake t&a fantasy like " the sword and the sorceress " and the infamous " deathstalker " series were the norm , " hawk the slayer " keeps it clean , and is all the funnier for it . if you have the right sort of friends , then snap this gem up , invite them over for beer and pizza , and have a go . it 's more than worth it	2

i will state first off that i 'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss pearl jam 's debut album , " ten , " as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is . if you think that makes me inherently biased ( unbalanced ? ) this review probably wo n't be " helpful " to you , and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews . if you decide to hear me out , i promise to be fair , ' cause even though i may be a hipster snob , i ca n't deny to myself the sweet rockin ' going on in " vitalogy . " this album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called " underground " or indie rock and the " classic " rock mainstream . thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it does n't sound sloppy . ballads like " better man " and its companion piece " nothingman " are clearly influenced by neil young and even " nebraska " -era springsteen- -they 're sincere & emotional but not mushy & sentimental . " not for you , " with it 's lyrics about how eddie vedder 's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes , is a none-too-subtle complaint about pearl jam 's status as " millions served " rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk . that , of course , is more directly the point of " spin the black circle , " an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to sst-era husker du . for vedder , the joys of vinyl are that they seem " warmer " - -a symbol of " tradional values " in a rock ' n ' roll sense : independence , hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny , sterile corporate plastic of compact discs . never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture ; vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12 " record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves . pearl jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference . on the other hand , the big corporate evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience , which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of " vitalogy " - -it 's designed as a salute / satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical / mental / spiritual hygeine . the album , therefore , aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band 's own youth ( the who , neil young ) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the power of rock ( fugazi , sonic youth ) - -hence the title . the album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like " bugs " and " hey foxymophandlemama that 's me , " even though they 're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel . still , some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like " last exit " and the somewhat proggy sea chanty " tremor christ " ( whose title i dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement ) . even though it 's uneven , " vitalogy " is the work of a self-reliant , even ornery band that 's in full control of their ideas- -even the bad ones . it 's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like stone temple pilots and matchbox 20.	4
i bought this cd for my two grandchildren for christmas . they have all the other nancy drew cd 's that are out and really enjoy playing them . they are a good interactive game to challenge their minds . i am sure this one will too	5
i wish i 'd listened to the other reviews . i bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me . claims a five year warranty but i ca n't return it to amazon so it 's just money wasted . be smarter than me , avoid this product if you value your money	3
tried this product for 2 weeks ; it did improve the clarity and softness , but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well , seemed to have a sticky feel . since then , i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare . this product performs like magic ; it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush . i can do the treatment 2-3x 's a week , ( like your supposed to ) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before . it is a magical product . bette hampton , chicago , i	3
i really like the rosetta stone product ( although it is over priced ) . warning : rosetta stone ( fairfield language technologies ) will not replace a cd if it is lost , stolen or damaged unless you bought the product directly from them ( and then they charge you $30 for a replacement cd ) . i had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package . in this case i can get my money back from the store i bought it from but since you ca n't backup the disks you had better be very careful to not lose one	5
the 4 cd mini gibson amp ' box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78 , and lp ' harder-to-get ' charlie christian / benny goodman recordings . legacy states " master takes " , but absolutely fails to research deep into charlie christian 's recording history . columbia vinyl 2lp 30779 , ( 1972 ) , and columbia 78rpm c -102 along with the columbia " sextet " cds leave legacy far behind . the wang wang blues -78rpm is n't in the 4cd set , and there are far too many ' false-starts ' , which benny goodman discarded for a good reason . star dust is only about 3 minutes , it 's 8 minutes on vinyl . there is even in-studio handclapping after some tunes . i have the 78s , many col . lps , and there is no " studio-live " takes . this 4 cd box could have , and should have been much better in information , content and genuine charlie christian guitar stylings . the 2 readily available bg sextet cds are a better purchase idea , but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl lp tracks , which are " the master takes " , left off the legacy / sony box set . musicologist 's suggestion , try to get the vinyl lps. skip this misleading 4 cd set of various tracks , + handclapping = not " good enough to keep " , ( airmail special ) . try the 2 benny goodman / charlie christian columbia cds , amazon has both , and most of the benny goodman sextet ' takes ' are master takes , and " good enough to keep !	4
i was pleased at the methods used to train your dogs from puppy to mature dogs . it covers several different styles of training , clicker and others . i would highly recommend it as a excellent resource in your inventory of training methods . i am using it on my 9 week old rat terrier and he will fetch , come sit and down with a little help and yes even shake hands	2
i got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great . i know i should probably replace the head by now , but it still seems to work fine , so i don't . i 've only changed the battery once . if you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type , this is it . then again , if you 're not lazy or weak , you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries	3
i recently purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom . compared to other products that i have evaluated , punch ! interior design suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility , stability , and 3d . it includes many precision , dimension , and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs . using the split 2d / 3d mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors . after i completed the drawings i showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as i had envisioned them . like most software i have used , this package does contains a learning curve . i by no means consider myself a computer guru and i had to put in a little practice time . you will find , however , a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual / tutorials to assist you with your project	5
" incredible " i saw one review describing this production . the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible . it is slow , convoluted and uninspired . no chemistry exists between the actresses , with no connection to the audience .	2
while i thought the series was getting a bit old by the 3rd movie , this is still a very good price for getting 3 decent movies . all have their funny moments . i still enjoy the first the best . mainly because the jokes were original and fresh . though it is still funny to see the strange things jim would get himself into . levy as his father was a great choice . this is worth the 20 dollars easy . lots of laughs , and plenty of gross out humor	2
i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it , and being through with it now , i feel as though i 've learned very little . i had so many problems with this book , or rather the way of writing , mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author , that this was a difficult read . in his defense , he is , in most things , very thorough . my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was ( or as he sometimes put it & quot ; must have been&quot ; ) thinking or feeling . while i give mr. bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject , in my opinion , that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views . since he himself stresses that leonardo 's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings , he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations . in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo 's life , the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter , but only puts forward his own opinion , and his reasons why he believes what he does , without explaining the opposite side of the matter . in this manner , he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter . sentences beginning with & quot ; i think&quot ; or & quot ; in my view&quot ; are not uncommon . he also makes certain assumptions about the reader , referring often to other artists ' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them . also , he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo 's , often drawing attention to coloring or texture , without ever showing it , though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout . the author is an undoubtedly intelligent , well-learned man , very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned , but entirely overbearing in his writing . overall , unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and do n't mind being pulled out of a book by the author 's views , then i would highly suggest staying away from this one	0
i purchased this camera in august 2006 and have sent it out for repair 4 times already for the same problem and it is november 2006. kodak just keeps telling me to send it to get repaired . is that right ? it takes great pictures but when you try to download them to your computer it works the first time . you try to do it a second time and it freezes and gives you a cannot read device message . i have two kids and the most important thing is to send picture emails to all the relatives across the globe on their updated lives . i now have to go to my local photo place to get a cd and prints made and then download them into my easyshare software . oh , should n't it be easier after spending that much money on a camera . also , i had to purchase a dock adapter for my printer dock . when i put the camera on the dock , it does n't charge the battery or print pictures , the screen just goes grey . this camera has had its main board and firmware repaired and replaced every time that it has come back to me . the cost of shipping , cd 's and prints has just added to the headache this camera has given me . kodak has not been helpful at all and they inform me the only form of communication of through email . what are they afraid of , they need to face the problem and satisfy their customers . do not purchase this camera , it is a great if you just never want to get them out of the camera	1
after many years of the same look and marginal upgrades , family tree maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product . there are still some awkward navigation issues , but overall , i think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and have n't upgraded in a while or are just starting out . having used the available online services that this company offers , i was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality . although the integration is a bit superficial , it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive . i think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible . too bad they do not make a mac version , as i prefer this to the mac products available and so i have to use it with parallels , which is not so convenient	5
i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets . however , i have to say this video was not what i expected . there were some great vintage clips , but not enough muppets / monsters for me . this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing . i would recommend you pass on this one and get " 123 count with me " instead .	2
this movie isnt worth the time to read this review . it sucks and i 'm a big trinity fan . my advice is keep searchin	2
the gs150 's performance is as-advertised . terrific colour rendering , thanks to its 3-chip configuration . the camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings , making it even more usable . love the joystick ! still find it hard to believe that panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package . final score : engineering 1 , customer service 0 early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem , which causes faint , red , horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions . despite the fact this has been widely ( if unofficially ) reported by gs150 owners around the world , these same owners have noted that panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists . thankfully , the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician . better still , gs150 owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from september 2005 onward are alright . look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with ' h5 ' or higher . you can also read all about this at pana3ccduser dot com	1
i love these bars , they are high in protien , and are good supplements , how ever the 3 boxes i got were all expired . beware of sale items on bars like this	3
i ca n't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video " easy to master " . i found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow . the camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork ! i am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner . i just excercised with this dvd for the first time and it was really tough ! i did n't get a work out at all because i was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much . she does n't break down the moves at all and it 's just so much more confusing than it needs to be . the dances are cute , but it 's frustrating that she does n't explain the moves . i hope no one else has to waste their money on this stupid thing	2
this is another piece of lowbrow anti-german propaganda dressed as historiography . the book is a mess of primary , yet selective and biased historical research , simplistic psycho-babble , ridiculous sociological-anthropological speculation , pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least , absolutely third rate military history . the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler , that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives . all in all , cheap trash billed as history .	0
i do n't own this cd . i do n't have to own it to review it , because this music is the soundtrack of my high school years . i lived this music . i listened to it while cruising the local shopping center indulging in - er - various activities . half of the bands on this cd i had the privilege of seeing perform live in the 70s . this is what fm radio sounded like back then . every single song on this cd was well known to me and my friends . yes , even black oak arkansas ( hot and nasty ! ) , nazareth ( get hair of the dog cd for more ) , and the runaways ( hot babes ! ) . oh , and i love the movie too . party on , dudes	4

as is typical with software claiming to be " topo " , it is not . expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for usgs quads this software is not as advertised . since i own the other major competing program ( for which you need to buy each state in order to get quads ( and for which i can not seem to find wyoming ) ) , i was eagerly awaiting this package . in five minutes i realized delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker / mountain biker ( et al ) . you can order quads very simply using the package , but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at delorme decided they would make the map blank ( apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece ) . so , you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it . well , if i knew that , i would already own the quad , and certainly would n't need to buy an electronic version . for 2.50 more i could get it laminated . yes , this is a flame , but it is deserved . delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want ; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go ( and then download , and pay for , the appropriate map ) . all in all , a complete waste of money- -i only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers of such software get a clue and discover a more appropriate business model ( versus selling blank maps , with a 100 dollar credit for maps that you do n't even know will work ) cheers .	5
i owned a kodak for awhile and was pleased with the pictures however , my husband accidently fell while ice skating and broke my camera . my family , knowing i love to take pictures , decided to replace my camera , but this time with a sony cybershot . i have never been more unhappy with a camera . needless to say , i finally decided to purchase this kodak z650 and am so pleased with the results and pictures . i am not a professional photographer , just someone who likes to take photos of my kids , pets , flowers , vacation spots , etc. my sony was horrible at action shots and if you had any movement what so ever , the photo appeared blurry . having kids , that is n't an option . i gave that camera to my daughter to do whatever she wanted with it . the kodak , however does a wonderful job of action shots as well as clear , crisp and concise pictures . i absolutely love this camera ! i will never go back to another brand and have only good things to say about kodak and their products	1
i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly . there are a lot of good books out there , dan harrington 's the very best , but this isnt one of them . too much ego here and not enough helpful information	0
starring sam from whose the boss and that guy that used to be married to christina applegate . i really hate this movie . it 's so boring and not exciting like drew barrrymores version	2
it does n't get any better than this . this album is a must have for all true judas priest fans . this is priest when they were really getting good . the guitars and the vocals rock you to the core	4
i hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful " supergroups " . ca n't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more ? there 's no such thing as a good supergroup . the supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck . when damn yankees released their 1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their " supergroup " scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they 're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right people ! supergroup members know that since they 're already popular , the album they 're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller- -- - " why bother trying to come up with good songs ? we 're already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . " supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more . if you buy any album by any supergroup , than you my friend , are a sucker ! if you want to hear shaw or blades at their best , just keep listening to any styx or night ranger album , and avoid anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup	4
i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i ca n't believe how disappointed i am for this . i was expecting fireworks ; instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head . not only that but it maybe the most over-the-top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw . to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like ' what is the meaning ? ' then there 's the film 's signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera . again i said to myself , ' what 's the point ? ' and then there 's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination-from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory 's character getting shot in the head . in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because ' oswald realized that he was raymond shaw . ' if he 's right that raises the question : did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over ? then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of " the manchurian candidate " and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 's what it is and why people today ( including me ) are still obessed with that decade . in conclusion , i think this was a big disappoinment . and this movie is on the list of afi 's 100 greatest films ? please .	2
the title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing . fitting that category as well are outlaw women , and women i 've never had . hank also lends his southern rockin ' style to white lightnin ' written by j.p. richardson a.k.a. the big bopper . what bocephus album would be complete without at least one tribute to his father ? hank serves up a whopper here along with waylon jennings in a classic called the conversation . in a time , much like today , when country was straying from it 's roots hank finds a way to keep the southern bluesy traditions alive on all ten cuts of this must have country album	4
i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0. performance is very poor , especially the organizer . it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are , such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera , compared to elements . recently , i 've been getting lots of crashes , though everything else on my system is completely stable . the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality , when it works correctly	5
i have never been a big fan of motivational books , because they seem so " pie in the sky " if you know what i mean . but a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different . he was right . it was easy to read and in fact i did n't want to put it down . but what i really liked was the " how to " part of the book . after all , it 's no good reading about other people 's success stories if you do n't know how to make your own . also , something i thought was interesting is that the author has a website called success compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder several times a day . i guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want , and this website does n't let you forget . hmmmmm . . . electronic nagging as the key to success ! ; - ) hey , whatever works	0
the batteries that come with this charger we 're not a problem for me . in fact , i was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine . i was however , disappointed in the charger . the charger requires that all four aa batteries be in the charger for it to work . you cannot charge just one , two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted . also , there are a maximum of two slots for aaa batteries and when they are in use none of the other aa slots are usable . given the price of nimh batteries , the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it 's worth at best .	3
this product must work for some people but obviously not for everyone . i started this 1 month ago , using it as directed with normal diet & regular exercise , & i 've gained 8 pounds ! on the up side , the price was low ordering thru amazon , so i would recommend if you 're really interested go ahead & try it , maybe it will work for you	3
good old silly , irreverent slade never really caught on in the us , but their melodic early-70s glam rock sounds as energetic and fun today as it did back then , and this is the best collection of their works , including all of the slade 's hit singles from the early ' 70s , from 1971 's & quot ; get down and get with it&quot ; to 1975 's & quot ; thanks for the memory ( wham bam thank you mam ) & quot ; . slade scored a whopping 11 top five hits between 1971 and 1974 ( five of which topped the charts ) , and they 're all here . so are their latter-day chart entries , like 1983 's #2 hit & quot ; my oh my&quot ; , but slade never got better than they did at their stomping glitter-rock peak , and & quot ; feel the noize&quot ; captures them in all their glory , filled with noddy holder and jim lea 's big , dumb , misspelled shout-along hits ( & quot ; look wot you dun&quot ; , & quot ; mama weer all crazee now&quot ; , & quot ; skweeze me , pleeze me&quot ; and & quot ; gudbuy t'jane&quot ; )	4

worked alright for a few months . i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation , hair pulls . i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads . it didn't . the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage , no doubt due to the cheap plastic used . never again	3

i have been slogging through this book for weeks now , it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium . the book lacks any narrative thrust , often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another . the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to " set the record straight " and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its " barbaric " european contemporaries	0
denzel washington is probably my favorite actor . even in that dog of a movie called the manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lemme quit hating the guy . this is a well-intentioned movie , tom did a creditable job , and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached . i was also pleasantly surprised to see antonio banderas fly in the face of his latino studliness by playing a gay guy . a passionate one , though , since he 's still a latino , after all . actually , this is a hollywood " message movie , " and you know what that means . it 's about as subtle as michael moore . those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours . those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie , those who do n't agree with the message , stay as far away from it as possible . there 's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with aids boy . the way they stared at him reminded me of " lao wei in china " experiences . denzel 's character was reminded of segregation , even though he 's too young to remember it , and started to care about tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination is bad . actually , any discrimination at all is bad . and that 's the movie 's message . i agree with the message , but still . that 's all we 've got . as a totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if the name " sam francisco " means anything to you , you 've seen subtle commentary on discrimination . i love a great courtroom drama . this one was merely good . with so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film , they had to take a few shortcuts here . sad , ai n't it ? but even so , a well-intentioned film that i 'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once is enough , thank you .	2
the most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone . the movie is a nokia product placement , highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and , conversely , what a phone can do for you if you have one . the plot centers on jessica ( kim basinger ) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need . mystery #1 : what is it ? after lots of running / driving in various parts of l.a. the bad guys round up jessica 's family , while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them . mystery #2 : how will the cell phone save the day ? mystery #3. watch for the credits at the end of the film . they show up on a.. . ? yep , you got it	2
i bought this camera for my 4yr old granddaughter who can handle my digital camera quite well and found it to be a total waste . the camera was much smaller than expected , trying to figure out what mode you 're in is ridiculous and the display is quite difficult to see let alone interpret . nothing is a simple " one step " procedure which you would expect for an item geared towards children . i was so frustrated setting it up that i did n't bother giving it to her . the software installed okay but was also far from " kid friendly " . i wish i would 've found and read these user opinions before making the purchase . ironically , the reviews i did see made it out to be better than the other cameras on the market for kids . i believe you 'd be better off purchasing a " regular " inexpensive digital camera for your potential " shutterbugs " .	1
this book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security , global warming , etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells . the author contributes little to previous books on the subject , such as rikin 's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public . if anything , the book 's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms . in doing so , the author comes up with some interesting case studies , but it 's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of the economist , which happens to be the author 's employer . moreover , there was little effort in integrating the various chapters . overall , a very disapointing book . the author should stick to journalism	0
once again , koch , for reasons that i cannot possibly fathom , assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog were n't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes . i know i 'm feeling large amounts of gratitude . it 's gratitude when you want to disembowel someone , right ? at least the copy i bought was used , so koch did n't make a dime off of me . anyway , this is another koch release that you should definitely avoid	2
i 've been using quicken for windows for years . since i recently bought a mac , i thought i 'd switch quicken over from mac to windows . forget it ! the mac version is totally incompatible with windows , you must export your data and then re-import it on the mac . this works ok for simple checking / visa accounts , but it **fails completely** for investment or brokerage accounts . if you look on quicken 's support site , they say " reinvest dividend , reinvest income and banking transactions in an investment account must be *manually entered* " hello ? ! like i 'm going to manually enter 12 years of investment transactions ? with most major products ( adobe creative suite , ms office ) , the same files work transparently across mac and windows . quicken 's inability to even import the data , nevermind actually opening it , reeks of incompetence . stay away from this product	5
& quot ; salvador&quot ; completely discredits joan didion and all of her books . the two weeks she is believed to have & quot ; lived&quot ; in el salvador was actually a mere four hours . any truths in this book , and there are but a handful , have been obtained by outside sources , not by her own & quot ; research . &quot ; i lived in el salvador when she came in to gather info for her story . it is an outrage that she so flippantly used the sufferings of the salvadorans to effect personal gain . if you want to read fiction , go ahead . she 's a good storyteller . as a service to yourself , however , keep in mind that the author has almost zero first hand knowledge of what she writes . the only reason i have the book at all is that my father gave it to me . what a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash	0
these wipes are awesome ! they got here real fast too !	3
you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera . the camera does not come close to fitting in this case . the camera is 1 1 / 2 inches wider than the case .	1

eddie murphy is a comical guy , but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this ? of course , who is the right guy for it ? one of the questions i ca n't stand to think about in this movie , is how dolittle hears the animals speak , but their lips move and nobody notices . ca n't they connect the dots ? obviously not . and obviously , the filmmakers could n't either	2
im a graphic design student in college , so i really needed a camera . i decided on this one and i am really glad i did . the pictures are nice and clean . the camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact . the only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera	1
while the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine , the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside . i have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better . i called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but do n't have any solutions . i asked if they had a website i could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2-3 months . right .	3

finally , fresh new characters which are adorable . i am a converted kutoka buyer as i have now bought a 3rd item from them . i was so impressed with the mia reading and mia language that i wanted to try this multi-subject game for my twin girls in kindergarten . this game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving . we have n't played with the art part yet but i still think it 's a great value for the other subjects . i 'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties . great product . even my neighbours kids come over to play it !	5
i got this for my s70. first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to " radio control " ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .	1
this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure . we 're yet to verify what the culprit is.. . but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch . i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor . it 's been consistant , reliable , and informative for both myself and my doctor	3
i recently discovered joyce cooling . yeah , i 've been in the dark ages . she is one of the smoothest guitarists out there and she does not try to sound like everyone else . i especially appreciate her percussive use of intonations . she 's got chops galore and is a beautiful woman to boot . you can hear it all in her music . buy revolving door ! you 'll love it	4

as a pretty big comedy fan thanks to xm radio , i have listened to a lot of comics and i own a lot of comic cd 's ( mitch hedberg , bill hicks , emo philips , lewis black , steven wright , pablo francisco etc. ) and my absolute favorite is unprotected . there is not a slow part on this cd and it never fails to bring everyone to tears on a long car ride . his quick and merciless wit is better than any other comic in the us . his family must be very understanding since he does n't hesitate to include every detail of their personal lives in his act , but it all serves to create a punchline that we can all relate to . the highlights of this cd are his daughter 's boyfriend and guidelines for resuming sex after a heart attack . i highly highly reccomend this	4
i bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new fodor 's is n't out yet . this has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations , but is n't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins . the maps are not comprehensive enough ( the one for modern jerusalem did n't cover a third of the city , and the one for tel aviv was tiny ) , and there is not enough practical information about food , hotels , and getting from place to place . i was disappointed .	0
this camera was a pain to pick the mode to get the camera to work . it 's batteries died all the time and lost all of the pictures . when you did get a picture loaded on the computer the software was terrible . we trashed it within 2 weeks of purchasing	1
as some of the other reviewers have mentioned , this us release has replaced the original source music . but the region 2 version has been released without these cuts , so for everyone with a multiregion player , i 'd suggest using amazon.co.uk to buy a copy there instead	2
jennifer jason...can someone puhleeze tell me why she always plays the same role ! and why all of her characters have seriously bad elocution ! the so called ~bostonish...or upper crust- -east coast accent does not include..slurring your words as if a consonant was too much work . it as if her upper lip is never engaged at all..not even to smirk ! does she have a botox complex..use your face..including your upper lip.. . but then again...maybe she was acting just like dorothy parker..who ahem..happens to be dead. . ! ( no disrespect intended. . ) jennifer beals played her little tiny wee part with so much more depth and nuance..why did n't she play parker..i believed her character ! gwyneth..love her. . ! bit part..but she added a much needed warmth to the film. . i cared for one character..and the best part was his bit giving a financial report..i thought that was brilliant. . ! bravo..but mr. benchley was the most endearing and 3 dimensional character..thank you. . will someone please make this film over..and do it right. . ! and do n't just call up your buds..for a tupperware party and say..hey..lets make a movie. . ! dorothy parker deserves much much better..i ca n't even imagine the biting remarks she would print..how about. . ' it 's all about me..and i hated it. . ! but the costumes were nice. .	2
this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 , but has face detection ( fd ) that autofocuses on faces in a photo . great for taking pictures of yourself , or for snapshots you do n't have time to compose . excellent quality photos in dim light . at 3200 iso , photos are washed out and noisy , but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss . option to limit iso to 1600 , or to 400. camera will use any speed up to the limit . 400 iso is extremely good . as good as my canon digital rebel xti . usual modes i never use ( flower , landscape , etc. ) , but one unique mode i use all the time : no flash / flash . the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso , and then takes a picture with flash immediately after . usually takes less than one second to capture both images . no flash does n't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot , while the following flash guarantees you 'll get the image , even if the " warm glow of candlelight " is ruined . i always have the camera set to this mode . uses xd cards , which i hate , but if you buy a 1 gb card you 'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card . also , battery life is unbelieveable ! fully charge the camera over several hours , and you 'll be able to take 400 photos , half with flash , before the battery is drained . fuji-brand underwater housing is optional , watertight to 40m ( 121 ft . ) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours , and still keep the intense blue of the water . literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras . i recommend this camera without hesitation . there simply is n't anything else like it on the market .	1

very simple review - the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month , then it didn't . save your box if you buy this , you may need to return it	3
i 've been kinda exclusive to remington ms3 's for a few years . they 've just been had inexpensively here and there so that 's the main reason i 've stuck it out . but in all honesty , these seem to cost me more than i 've thought in the past . like other reviews have stated , this razor takes effort to get close . hair does collect on the foils and thus as i 've noticed , causes the blades to bind on stubble . i 'm a patient person , not usually in a hurry to shave , so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning . but here 's the weakness : the foils are like paper , and flake holes in them . i just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks ( a good deal i thought for a microscreen 3 ) . my other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two ( once a hole developed , and i 'd rashed up my neck accidentally , i removed the bad foil ) . i 'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those . so i thought a new unit was the trick . well , now just three months later , the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two ( used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out ) . my bathroom is riddled with these things . my patience is now out and i 'm headed back to an old faithful : braun	3
francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's ' ride of the valkyries' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : ' this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy	2
i 've been a onenote user from the original release ( onenote 2003 ) , and this version improves on an already exceptional product . organize your life using this one application , and never go back to paper again	5
i 'm holding on the phone right now trying to get support for this product . there is no 800 number for tech-support , so it 's a long distance call . i have had the same issue for over a month and still have not been transferred to a tech support person . they offer only email support , but do n't write back . if you call them on the phone they tell you a support person will call you , but it never happens	5
the software is easy to install and easy to use . the " import prior year 's return " feature saved time in completing multiple returns . i completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature . i also discovered the " save as pdf " feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom i prepare returns . i have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year . the premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules	5
i will not lash out against anyone , and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious , ostentatious egotism . that said , let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth 's solutions extremely difficult to accept . first off , it does n't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus 's morals in general terms . if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us , then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus 's codices . the key point here is that jesus 's older analects were deluded enough . his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale . jesus 's peuplade appears to be growing in number . i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations , circumvent any further litigation , and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death - - all by trumping up a phony emergency . his desire to control your bank account , your employment , your personal safety , and your mind is the chief sign that he 's a slaphappy caitiff . ( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo " treatment " to cure my " problem " . ) perhaps i 'm reading too much into jesus 's ravings , but they do n't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests . jesus 's précis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent , noxious feudalism . that 's pretty transparent . what 's not so transparent is the answer to the following question : does jesus 's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities ? a clue might be that every time he tries , jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions . this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought , but for imagination as well . jesus 's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity . and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing . ( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil ? ) jesus of nathareth has an agenda - - a political , social , and cultural agenda . and that 's all i have to say .	0
my five and six year old love this game ! it sparks their interest in things around them and now we play our own " i spy " riddles in the car , at dinner or out on walks . i highly recommend it	5
of course dead alive was the better movie . but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate , due to the fact that there is a high body count , lots of over-the-top splattery deaths , and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers , some as zombie lunch . apparently there was some footage cut out for this release . i 'm not sure if that was gore footage or not , but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence . there is even some non-gore & quot ; grossout&quot ; humor ( vomit-related , etc. ) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive . sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground , but again the influence is unquestionable . do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though , this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly . i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print / transfer , but it 's a minor distraction . they did a great job with a relatively small budget . i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us ( hopefully uncut ) dvd release- -i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy	2
this is a great lens for any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive / clean results . a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this is easily correctable with software . in addition , the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus . i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door / architecture shots ( especially realtors )	1
fast delivery , great price . i would buy from them again , thanks =	1
looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads " panasonic " , not " lumix " . fits the camera perfectly . no extra room for memory cards , spare battery , charger , etc. it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down . the belt loop wo n't fit most belts . no straps . however , the camera 's strap is good enough . good protection	1
from a pure image quality standpoint , this lens will not please the pixel peepers . on the wide end of the zoom , which i personally use more often than the telephoto end , this lens is not very sharp , and it suffers from fairly bad distortion . worse than that , for me , are the chromatic abberations ; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end , which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness . given the price of this lens , one should expect a higher level of optical performance . the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large , being f / 4 on the wide end , and f / 5.6 on the telephoto end . the image stabilization makes up for this some , as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let 's be honest here ; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod . the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder , which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark ( using a tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , and this is not without reason . first of all , the focal length range is quite handy . it is n't a mega-zoom that does everything , however , it covers the most often used focal length ranges , and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations . the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion , and it 's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end , but zoomed in , it 's quite good . i have printed as large as 20x30 " using this lens on a digital rebel , and have no qualms with the results . yes , there are sharper lenses out there , but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print . this lens has ring usm , which enables it to focus very quietly , and very quickly , whereas the slightly cheaper ( and f2.8 ) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison . if you want to use this lens indoors , you are best off getting a flash to go with it , such as a 430ex . the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting , or during the day , but wo n't give you good results in low light with no flash . if you will be shooting in lower light situations ( people in particular ) , tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures , and i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you 'd prefer the extra telephoto range , the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field ( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f / 4 , for instance , without image stabilization , you could use f / 11 on this lens , and get a sharp picture with better depth of field . this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this is n't a true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without a tripod , you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field , and the is helps with that quite a bit . overall , i 've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens . if you like to worry about splitting hairs , and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer , this lens is likely to dissapoint you . if , however , you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded , useful lens , then i 'd recommend it , however , would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options , as they are also great lenses , and do offer a somewhat better value	1
when i got this camera for my birthday april 2005 i thought that it was a dream come true . the picture quality was brilliant , it was easy to use . the device was ment to be envied . it took marvelous pictures until within 3 months , july 2005 - the lcd screen cracked . the camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage . i was never suspiscious of it until i took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems . something bad will happen to this camera . either the sceen will break or the memory card thing . a friend of mine also owned the s410 , and her screen broke before mine did . the camera still takes photos , but without the screen the device is near worthless as you have no options . it is not worth the price of repair . tomorrow i am going to buy a new camera .	1
i cannot stop listening to the song i saved the world today . the cd is worth the price for this song alone . the whole cd is great though ... classic eurythmics that sounds as great today as their earlier work . annie lennox gets all the attention ... and she deserves every bit , but dave stewart certainly deserves as much . they make a great team and this cd should have been given much more attention in the usa . i hope they do n't take so long to do another one	4
this camera has major problems . do your research . go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of the " black screen " . after using our camera about 5 times the screen became black . apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something . sent it to their customer care service . took 1 month to get back . 3 days later black screen is back . sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera . they just want me to keep sending to customer . care . sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras . see for yourself . go to the forums and see what others have been saying . do n't make the mistake i did	1
this product offers a realy equity between price and quality , and a good results in photos	1
this is a really nice compact camera from canon . the picture quality is excellent . i have tried some night / day shots and the pictures are great . the zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for . the build quality is excellent and i really love the 3 " display . i find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it . the camera is very compact but i never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand . the images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original canon battery and its available on amazon . the accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original canon parts especially the extra battery . also get a sd card with large enough memory . what comes with the camera ( 32mb ) is really a waste . still do n't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card . but overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results	1
bought the charger and an extra battery . when my camera battery started getting low i tried to charge the batteries and the device just sat there trying to charge but never charged the batteries . competely useless . have to go buy a different charger	1
i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera . i have had all types of cameras over the years , mostly 35mm film canon slr's . i too bought all sorts of these 5-7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love , slr's . i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it . it lacks nothing . although the kit lense is good , i bought a 28-135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it . i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus , i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture . i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it . its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be , it wo n't hold you back . the battery life is great , the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better . i never figure i 'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you ca n't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description.. .	1

" american gigolo " stars richard gere of a high priced male prostitute . he is coasting along with his rich southern cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered . when he is considered the main suspect , he goes on the run , with his only friend being the wife of a politician . at the begining he tells people that he is a moral man , for example , he dos n't service gays , more on that in a moment . it is interseting to note that gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in " pretty woman " and it made a star out of julia roberts . but that is where the similarities end . this is a much darker story about hypocracy . when he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him . in the end , he finds himself a hypocrit , because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job ; gays , s and m , anything to avoid jail . the only love story here is about him and the politician 's wife ( lauren hutten ) . it is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him , even for his own protection . for all it 's darkness there is one funny scene . richard gere is called in for a line up at the police department . he tells the other men in the line up that he got paid , and the others get angry and cause a scene , averting the attention off of gere . this is a really good movie as an examination of society 's attitude toward sex . this film was written and directed by paul schrader , if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to " taxi driver " . richard gere is wooden , but his character is cold and icy , so that approach is right . lauren hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man ; she seems sincere in wanting to help gere . but i thought the standout performance was bill duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing ( as oppose to gere 's ' madam ' ) , but also provides the warning to gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out . and another future " pretty woman " player is present ; hector elanzo . he plays the detective on gere 's trail ; but he is slimy and rather unlikable here . well worth your time , but for adults only	2

i just saw this woman live and she 's amazing ! ! ! ! the songs come alive when you hear them ! it 's hard to put into words the state that her music and lyrics put you in . but trust me it 's a good place ! please check her music out if you 're into heartfelt music	4
look , notation software is notoriously expensive . all musicians know that . so , when you see songwriter and its price , it 's a relief . everything you need is in this program . i only have one complaint . when adding an expressive dynamic ( p , mp , mf , f , ff , etc. ) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback . that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes . it leaves an ugly looking score . other than that , this is the best deal on the market for what it is	5
i 've been using 35mm slr cameras for over 30 years . for the last 9 or 10 years i have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved . this kodak z710 is a very economical compromise . the built-in 10x optical zoom is a great feature . the z710 does not have image stabilization ( is ) as do some of the more expensive models but if you have a moderately steady hand and you press the shutter button rather than pound it ( and the whole camera ! ) that 's not really a problem . another feature of this camera that i really appreciate is the manual settings position which allows much more creative control of a shot . check out the kodak web site for more information on this . i bought this camera from an amazon dealer for less than $200 shipped to me . that 's cheaper than a reconditioned unit ( same model ! ) recently sold on ebay	1
unlike most other items i 've bought from amazon , i failed to read the reviews for this particular cd before purchasing . being a fan of the final fantasy series , i think i fell into a bit of the " fanboy " ( well in my case , " fangirl " i guess ) syndrome . also i did n't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording , which it most certainly is not . i own most of the final fantasy ost 's ( and heartily endorse them for fans of the games ) and this particular cd does nothing new or compelling to the music . tracks 1-7 are pretty much carbon copies of their ost counterparts . track 8 , the opening theme of ffviii ( liberi fatali ) has a very odd synth-solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section . tracks 9-11 again are basically copies of the ost . track 12 , " alexandria ( vivi 's theme ) " is the only somewhat-original track , as it seems to put together several pieces from the ffix soundtrack in a medley of sorts . unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything ff , i recommend saving up and purchasing the real ost 's instead of this disc . while i do n't see non-fans flocking to purchase this disc , it might be worthwile if you 're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste . even in that event i 'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely . pros : cheap ( i paid $6 , new ) track 12 is worth a listen cons : tracks 1-7 , 9-11 offer nothing much new or different track 8 has creepy ( in a bad way ) synth / voice mixe	4
if you are a christian , this book is n't for you . it is full of blashphemy , concluding that we must " ... forgive god " and that we must love god " ... even if he isnt perfect " . kusher even has the will to say that " ...god would not be god.. . " without our love for him . at one point he reduces god to an aminal saying that in the garden of eden , when god said " ...let us make man in our image " he was speking to animals and creation . kusher explains that god created the world , and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution . since when was god in need of forgiveness ? isnt it that " ... god so loved the world " and it wasnt us that loved god ? i have no words in describing this book . it is full of error , because it does not base it self on the gospel of jesus christ . all this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner , and that it isnt your fault , and that actully you are a good person . why do bad things happen to good people ? wrong question . there are no good people in the world in the first place . " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god.. . " the world is in sin . the world does not have good people ! ! only by the grace of god , through faith in jesus christ you are made righteous . i beg you in the name of jesus christ to stay away from this book . it hasnt helped 4 million people , but it lied to them . kusher , please turn from your ways and come to jesus , then will you understand the life question " why "	0

joe cocker has one of the most distinctive gravelly voices in r & b history . he 's always stuck to his roots and never gone with temporary fads or novelties . this collection is another classic with great covers from the beatles , elton john and gary wright . his interpretive voice has always been the focal point of his songs , but in dts 5.1 , you are surrounded ( as if in concert ) by his presence . the completely adept and intuitive musicians that accompany him add more atmosphere without taking from his performance . imagine hearing him in live in a theater and you 'll know what to expect from this warm and heartfelt album	4
sorry , bill ! poor lyrics and only fair production have made this a most disappointing purchase . the guitar playing is adequate , but not good enough to save this material . i hope bill spends a little more time on the thought process before bringing out his next material .	4
i will keep this review simple . for the price this is an ok deal . however : the bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop . the battery charger is finicky and has below average build quality batteries are generic rechargeables . you are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger / batteries . it will wind up costing you less in the long run	1

this straightener is great for thin hair.. . but not for thick . i myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy . the best hair straighteners out there are about 1&quot ; thick or less and they normally have glass plates . so if you have thick hair , spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality	3
there is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on amazon - you would n't buy if you could . i read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way . this band is nothing even near metallica . i have thrown the disk away - do n't bother	4
the casio exilim ex-s770rd is a great camera for the price . camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket . lcd sreen is large and very clear . 7.2 mp produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed . as this is my first casio purchase , i am very pleased with the quality	1
this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths , and underlying the story are indeed echoes , sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted , of ancient myths . god is allegorized as gabalawi , the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs . the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters . the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad . then there is a fifth story , in which the central figure , a ` magician ' , is presumably a scientist . he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it , but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' . it makes no difference : the scientist , who has invented a weapon of great destructive power , is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer , and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever , though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering . subtle the book is not , either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive . the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names , but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another . a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent . they mostly ` shout ' , ` scream ' , ` shriek ' , ` yell ' , ` cry ' or ` sneer ' , which becomes rather tiresome . the literary quality of this novel is , i think , greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature . but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life .	0

when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove , there was no better sounding group than qms . cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring . unfortunately , one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure . without cipollina , qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group , despite the talents of duncan , freiberg and elmore . i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this.if you want to hear them at their best , buy the 1st album , happy trails , or lost gold and silver	4
i purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera . when i was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house , there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo . when i took a photo outside , there was no shadow . i went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said i would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room , but he said , in reality , ' these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments' . i did experiment with the light balance , but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear.the flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks . i returned the product .	1
this is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical , haunting scores ever composed for a film . each succeeding track is a treat for the ears , refreshing and invigorating . neeley and varese sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem . in my opinion , though , the only part of the entire cd that does n't work is the beginning of the " waxworks " track - the score to this particular moment in the film ( when norma , watching herself onscreen , rises triumphantly to proclaim " i 'll be up there again , so help me ! " ) is one of the most powerful and recognizable images in filmdom . in the original , the music is strong , powerful and almost spine-tingling , but this moment on the cd is underwhelming and not fully realized . however , what is one misfire ( totalling all of eight bars , at most ) compared to the richness and texture of the rest of the recording ? ! in short , if you love film music , you most likely love the score to sunset boulevard - and if you love sunset boulevard , then you will most likely love this recording , too	4
i have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer " pinches " or cut people , but i have n't found that to be the case . i would n't use it in ultra sensitive places ( but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas ) but it does the trick quite well . i have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price . it also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver ( which was n't advertised when i bought it ) but worked well on my legs ; not as great as some more expensive electric leg shavers but is great when you do n't have much time . all in all i suggest buying it .	3
sounds like the background music used in the 70 's rockford files tv crime show...and a little like the chips music too . similar to music by tom scott from back then . the crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky , they are more smooth groovin funk . the sound for the times is very clean , too produced for true funkyness . do n't get me wrong i like the old 60 's jazz crusaders , just not this 70 's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent , and continue to do so , it 's where the money is . no improvisatory feel either . this is for smooth jazz lovers . hard funk lovers will be disappointed , as will true jazzers . i wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60 's but they keep burying it like it never happened , even to this day , afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid / late 60 's true jazz albums . their 70 's albums like this are partly to blame for today 's smooth jazz.. . in other words , not really jazz , not really funky , just kind of smooth groovin , more for casual adults and offices . not challenging , not offensive , formulated to an extent . but hey if you like this , that 's cool , just dont think it 's real jazz , or real funk . it 's smooth and casual , slightly simmers , pleasant background music , but does n't cook like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz , funk , and fusion . it just sounds like they are holding back...i know they can play more advanced , and write more creatively , they just choose not to ever since the 60 's	4
i took passion rx because i am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion . i had great success the first week i took this product . in fact i was so pleased , i bought 2 more bottles . however , the second week , i went back to having no sex drive . and even though i am continuing to take passion rx , it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week . i take 2 pills each day in the morning , and have done so for over a month . i suppose everyone is different but i wo n't purchase any more . plus i just saw a webpage from consumer health digest that gives it low rating compared to other products : http : / / consumerhealthdigest.com / top25female.htm ? source=overute / passionrx&ovraw=passion%20rx&ovkey=passion%20rx&ovmtc=standar	3
have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities . do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens ; for the price it is a nice lens . i tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor 's roof using 200 mm telephoto . when you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name ! without the image stabilizer , it is a blur . i did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting . without image stabilizer the title is blurred ; with the image stabilizer it is sharp . a very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save , or use filters to make them bw , soft , more bright , or with different color tones . people report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash . this is true . however , you can use the p mode , which is like an auto mode , reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice ! . great low light capabilities with image stabilizer . if you are into action photography , this may not be the camera for you . it has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay . other camers react faster and have larger capacity . do reset default from bright to natural tone . you can do this in some modes , but not all . read the manual , it really will empower you with many nice capabilities . newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically	1
microsoft continues their legacy of software that does n't work . i 've been using windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems microsoft has released . you would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this , instead it is many steps backwards . btw , i have a 4400 amd , 3 gigs of ram , and can say that vista is slow slow slow . be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on xp . cool interface , about the only positive thing about vista i have found so far . searches are also much faster , but hardly a reason to upgrade . be prepared for windows updates after installing vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working . i 'm tempted to go back to xp , so needless to say a big waste of time and effort .	5
rhymefest is an ok rapper and the first two joints are bumping . man , i thought i was in for a classic hip hop album , it was like the lakers were ahead by 30 points then all of a sudden the other team caught up and eventually won the game because after that it was just wack track after wack track . i admire his thought provoking lyrics but if the beat ai n't hittin i could care less what you 're rapping about . rhymefest used so many r&b singers i thought i was listening to some old new edition or after 7 joints not that i do n't like those singers but i do n't want to hear that on no hip hop album . if you want to hear some real chicago hip hop check out all natural the best besides common to ever come from the city of wind	4

this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n't be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n't repeat their details . i 'll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 " xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper 's ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n't confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n't kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you 've grown fond of hd , i think you 'd be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n't play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i 'm not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i 've only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n't have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n't report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i 'm perfectly happy with a 2.7 " lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n't a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n't seen them before , there 's a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you 'll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder 's menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n't find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you 've got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 " or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they 're not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all " more " than in the hc90. so i think i 'm fine with the battery life , but you 'll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it 's maybe 1 / 2 " longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it 's noticeably smaller than last year 's sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n't see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it 's pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n't load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 's tape case is maybe 3 / 8 " wider than the ux5 's dvd case . the ux5 's dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 " higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 's extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year 's avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n't out , so i do n't know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i 'd call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n't weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : " how much money do we have ? " , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that 's not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i 've read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i 'm sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i " understand " . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we 're talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it 's really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully .	1

i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years . this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement . it 's nice and quiet , and i 'm sure the vacuum works great , but i would n't know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim . we 're talking about hairs easily 1 / 4 " in length . a trimmer should be able to shave those down , do n't you think ? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors . do n't bother even trying this product , it 's a waste of money	3
i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1.3mp digital camera binocular . the first one had software / hardware that hung up after 3 pictures , the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable , the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box . a truely tatty product	1
this is a wonderful item if or when it works . it prints the pictures beautifully if it works . the trouble is that after using it for a little while ( and i mean a little while ) it will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink . i have messed with it and messed with it , for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this does n't work all the time . right now my printer wo n't work and i cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink are n't cheap . i think it is cheaper going down to walmart and using their instant photo machine . this is not worth the money or the aggravation ! ! ! !	1
i was ( and still am ) a huge fan of " mr. show " . it was the only reason i kept my hbo subscription . it 's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created " mr. show " produced this weak offering . might be the least funny comedy cd i 've ever heard . virtually all the material in the album has been done before , and much better , by other comedians . most of the bits just lay there and die . mr. cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot . sorry , it just does n't work . do n't waste you money on this one . get the " mr. show " dvds instead and forget this ever existed .	4
i do television editing for my church and i dabble alittle at home . i have many editing programs that i use for music and video editing of home movies from cams and 8mm.i had nero 6 and it was ok , but nero7 ultra ( enhanced ) has taken the place of all the other programs . it is my primary editing suite for music and videos . for music i can make changes to songs for skating programs where i would have to send out to have words removed or create a cd for pleasure.this program is remarkable , there are still somethings i have not yet used , this was the best but in this type of program for under $800.00 that is how much the programs that we use in the studio starting price is . buying this program will be a great investment .	5
this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes . we purchased it for a cruise , because we wanted to carry-on the camcorder and have it protected , but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories . this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	1

for average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this . i do n't know about the specifics , but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months . so , i do n't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does n't even take a picture . it was fine while it worked , it ate batteries but the pics were good	1

i have been using microsoft operating systems for a very long time , and , i still say that this is the best system out there , for many reasons . an increasing amount of linux and mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs , and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks . in response to linux users - stay away from linux , linux is free for a reason . it is compatible with very very few programs as it is , and that number will only decrease . for gamers - rarley do i see a linux compatible game . just stay away from this system . for mac users - mac 's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs . fewer and fewer programs can run on them , and like linux , that number will only decrease . the only thing keeping macintosh alive is itunes . which is compatible with windows . besides , when direct x 10 comes out , it will only be available for windows , making macintosh 's un-usable for new games when the next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . the computers are also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you can get viruses on mac 's	5
i am listening to badfinger even as i type this review . this is the best of badfinger vol 2 , and i thought volume 1 was great ! ! as previous reviewers have said , what an absolute tragedy the story of badfinger is ( buy the book " without you " the tragic story of badfinger ) . well i have everything they have released , if you do buy any of the badfinger best ofs , you will more than likely get hooked and start collecting all of their albums.some of the best songs on this cd are off " wish you were here " their best album by a mile imho.in fact 6 of the 9 songs on wywh are on this compilation . they were such an original group with every member capable of writing an exhilirating hit song . just have a taste of " just a chance " , " you 're so fine " , " meanwhile back at the ranch / should i smoke " .they were just so good , damn i miss them	4
at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples , but i found that by re-sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better . also , the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away . just look at the samples that come pre-loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great-looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution . after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results . **another plus : this one came with a wall charger . most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge . the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer	1
this album is a great representation of what spoon is about . great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears . spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well . they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting . some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind , the two sides of monsieur valentine , sister jack and i turn my camera on . i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock . definately money well spent	4
john sturges acquires a reputation as a solid director of superior westerns filled with tense action scenes such as : " escape from fort bravo , " " bad day at black rock , " " backlash , " " gunfight at the o.k. corral , " " the law and jack wade , " " the last train from gun hill , " " sergeant three , " " the hallelujah trail , " and one of the best of all wyatt earp movies , " hour of the gun . " he succeeds in one of the most exhilarating opening sequences of all western movies , when he had mcqueen and brynner riding a hearse up legendary boot hill creating a mood and peril that never allow the slightest degree of viewer confusion or ennui.. . for sturges , the west is a man 's world , and his cool , hard , detached style , emphasizing action , excitement and the rugged environment of the frontier , endorses the point.. . " the magnificent seven " is derived from kurosawa 's superb " the seven samurai , " a compelling tale of intimidated and impoverished medieval villagers hiring mercenary warriors to repel bandit ravages.. . the villagers in this case are mexicans , plagued beyond all bearing by the activities of bandit calavera , who always leaves them on tortillas and few beans.. . three of them cross the border to offer meager pay and sustenance for any professionally skilled fighting men who will aid them.. . yul brynner is the man , dressed in black , with the luminous dome and the hypnotic mongolian eyes who portrays the distinctive chris adams leader of the seven hired gunmen hired to chase some ' flies from a little mexican village . ' eli wallach is memorable as calvera , chief of the ruthless outlaws.. . he is greedy and merciless terrorizing without pity the poor peasants.. . steve mcqueen gives a standout performance as the sardonic gunman ( ' we deal in lead , friend ' ) , carrying appealing ease and sense of humor to his role as vin , brynner 's first recruit and second-in-command.. . charles bronson portrays bernardo o'reilly , who explains his curious name to chris , with ' mexican on one side , irish on the other- -and me in the middle ! ' bronson , the strongest face in western , and with a bit of mexican in him- -cunning face , steady eyes , revealing voice- -the character of bernardo o'reilly suits him perfectly.. . this half-breed gunfighter becomes the conscience of the team.. . because of his tender paternal instincts , he is adopted by three children who promise him , in case he falls , to bring him , every day , fresh flowers.. . robert vaughn- -who was to do nicely on tv in " the man from uncle " spy spoof- - plays lee , the ' good gun ' with black gloves and nightmares , living in style with no enemies alive.. . brad dexter plays harry luck , brynner 's happy friend who returns to join the team convinced of the existence of a large amount of hidden gold.. . james coburn makes a big impression as britt , the expert gunman who can out-draw a gun with his knife-throwing.. . his looks and vague figure of violence are quite a response for his few talks.. . horst bucholz represents youth , eagerness , and the urge to be proved and sorted out from the boys.. . he was caught on the road by rosenda monteros.. . robert j . wilke is britt 's insisting challenger who swells the ranks of the villains in many westerns like " high noon , " " the far country , " and " man of the west . " the magnificent seven 's success spawned three sequels : " return of the seven " ( again starring yul brynner ) , " guns of the magnificent seven " and , last and least of all , " the magnificent seven ride . " with a terrific oscar-nominated musical score by elmer bernstein , " the magnificent seven " remains a richly enjoyable western , shot on location in morelos state , mexico.. .	2
i had not realized what great performers michael flatley , colin dunne and jean butler were until i watched this version of riverdance . the lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions . what made riverdance great for me was the precision , timing , and dancers dancing togeather in the irish dance numbers . it is all gone here . try " riverdance : live from new york city " or the video tape " riverdance : the show " instead . this version should not have been released	2
this movie showed what an amazing dancer gene kelly was . this is one movie i recommened for anyone who loves the world of dance , thinks gene kelly is hot ( lol ) or if you love musical theater .	2
this movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and amazon customers that i was expecting great things . while i agree the acting ( especially the girls playing christy and ariel ) is excellent the story is just too implausible and i got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from canada to the us ( yes they are irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the us from canada ) . anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the us with their two kids illegally , without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country ? i know the dad is an actor but could n't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to manhattan ? the mom is a teacher but ca n't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally . yet there is money for private school , fixing up the dump of an apartment , an expensive camcorder , betting the rent money on an et doll etc. i ca n't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the " drug house " with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please . mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died . i kept expecting someone to call social services . and the medical situations with both frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched . the symbolism between mateo , the new baby and frankie is very heavy handed . though the film is told through the oldest daughter 's eyes because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children . and there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all . maybe if i had taken it more as a fable i would have " gotten " this movie more but i was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed .	2
just today i randomly selected a movie , that movie was " henry " . i had never heard of it before , and i figured that i was in for your average , run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick . though it is low budget , it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie . in fact , the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study . meet henry , a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition . watch as he goes to work , watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis , and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people . this film does not exploit the violence though ; it is very frank and direct , treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park . this movie is a lot of things , and when it was all over , i just had to sit back and take a few breaths , have a cigarette - and try to gauge my reaction ( s ) . i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing , it is also pretty funny in some parts , though only funny in the blackest sense of the term . there is no social commentary in this movie , nor does it provide any closure . the dvd is great , awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas , awaiting lethal injection on death row . very fascinating	2
" debut " is used to describe someone 's first release . not their third . a classic , 5 stars...pmg in an exciting , formative mode	4

loved them all ... found victoria & amp ; albert and lorna doone a bit lacking . wondered about having more of the scarlet pimpernel offered - he 's so smooth ! tom jones is very special - loved sophie 's father , he truly made the film . as much as i liked him - hated lizzie 's mother in p & amp ; p - what a ninny ! this is a great collection , would have liked to see vanity fair and persuasion offered also	2
i rented this ( sigh ) several years ago , liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but did n't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today . i regretted buying a new copy after all , remembering it only as a few heartwarming ( i did n't want my heart warmed ) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct . ( incidentally , the 3 girls are not sisters , just 2 of them . ) i made fun of it , my friend made fun of it , i watched a few minutes then turned it off , then watched some more , finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it . it has charm . it is a soap opera , but i thought it was well acted and well done . it had humor , happiness , sadness , embarrassment ( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid 's car ) , love . it had so much plot that it practically had none at all . and i liked it . but now , 15 minutes later , i 'm beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it . i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick . that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all , no range , no depth , somehow he could carry a tune , but that 's about the size of it , speaking of size , the size of his ego ( which i assume is why he did n't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics ) would have made a mushroom cloud ! i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing . for it 's kind , i thought it was perfectly done . i just like them a smidge more sophisticated . the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious .	2
well , unless you are a hardcore collector like myself ( had it originally on vinyl all those years ago ) , stay clear of this album . if you want to hear noise that you & your wife / girlfriend / boyfriend could do yourself , then forget this album & make your own noise . the best track on the album is the bonus track . that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music . i give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ; - ) . search judemac forever " on msn	4
the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 ( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body ) . i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1. with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out . if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all . there 's also no padding to speak of with this case . by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure , padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently . apparently it does fit some cameras , just not the panasonic fzs . considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price	1
these 3 discs ( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! ) are a continuation of live dead . if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead . you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band . the playing , the interplay between the musicians - particularly garcia and lesh is staggering . and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums	4
i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up . well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been . so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it . then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there . they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem . they never fixed the problem . mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son 's life before the age of 2. i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera . well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera , but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped . she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera . i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time . i started to cry that my son 's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone . the camera is worse than a disposable camera . do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk . i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter . please do n't waste your time on this , like i have to ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me	1
this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out . i was delighted with the larger size , but the new pad did not heat at all . i returned it to homedics ( along with the $5 handling charge ) , and two months later they sent a replacement . the replacement heats up , but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted . it almost looks like it has melted to itself , and it ca n't be flattened out . i wo n't be sending this one back with another $5 handling charge- -it is n't worth it . this one goes out with the trash , and i go back to sunbeam .	3
this is the first digital camera that i have owned . overall i am generally satisfied with the quality of the pictures it produces . however , there are a few things that , if i had known beforehand , would have prevented me from purchasing this camera . 1 ) camera is not plug-and-play ( even if they say it is ) . you have to install the kodak easyshare software to download pictures . this is a huge negative . in the future , i will only buy cameras that show up as removable storage drives when plugged into a computer . 2 ) video is stored in apple quicktime format ( *.mov ) . the is also a huge negative . the codecs for this format are not widely available for application integration . you have to download and use apple quicktime to view them . you can not view the videos in windows media player . it is also not compatible with some photo-album software . i would only buy cameras in the future that have an option to store video in a non-proprietary format . update : after review , i have found that winxp and vista plug-n-play with the camera when it is plugged into the usb port . it does not work on win2k . thanks for the comment that made me double-check	1
i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie . to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country . even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today , the message is still clear . those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie . this is certainly one of burt lancaster 's better roles , and he plays it with much guesto ! if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background . this movie has a strong message . do n't listen to the word of god from others . if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible , do so in your own way . do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money ! even in this modern day and age , the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong . mr. bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re-election ! everyone who is a born again christian , or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country . the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived , meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty ( if there is one ) . still , a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today .	2
do you know how clever alan trachtenberg is ? i mean , do you really , really know ? ! because if not , this book is for you . trachtenberg 's book is only superficially about indians or americans , it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things- -because he is very clever , you know . in so far as this book has a thesis , that it is it	0
this is the cheesiest music ever . phil collins , glenn frey , chaka khan ? are you kidding me ? these were the worst artists of the 80's . where 's u2 , rem , the pixies , x , the pretenders , tom petty , prince , springsteen , the replacements , husker du ? does anyone like rock and roll ? phil collins writes songs for disney and pixar now ! what did glenn frey know about ' smugglers blues ' ? do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart ? these are the worst artists , songwriters and performers of the 80's . enjoy the nostalgia , but the art which is song is seriously missing on this cd .	4
my cousin 's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i 've been pretty active in this area for some time , just now starting to go full digital ) , and i 've used the f / 2.8l about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses i 've used . period . shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots , as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots ( of crowds , the freeway at night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing , but it can be removed easily enough . i personally just purchased the f / 4.0l , which , coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20d , should do nicely , but i still rate the 2.8 high up on my list	1

steven spielberg 's classic masterpiece jaws did not have a stellar plot . it was a bubblegum storyline : a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast . in the hands of any other director , it would have been a terrible film , something to laugh at on lonely saturday nights while chowing down popcorn . in the hands of mr. spielberg , however , it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made . steven spielberg 's hands were nowhere near jaws : the revenge . okay , so here 's the plot . remember jaws 3-d ? well , that never happened . chief brody - from the first movie - is dead . his wife , ellen brody ( lorraine gary ) , is living a happy life in amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark . ellen flies down to the bahamas with her other son , michael brody ( lance guest ) . though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy , ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes , the one that chief brody killed - is back for revenge , hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one . even though it died . in the first movie . confused ? any sensible moviegoer would be . it 's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third jaws sequel . as you now know , the story is completely absurd . the script , by michael de guzman , is unintentionally hilarious , filled with outrageously funny dialogue . for example , in one scene , pilot hoagie ( played by michael caine ! ) is courting ellen brody . hoagie : i have an irresistible urge to kiss you , ellen brody . ellen : why ? hoagie : because ... it would not occur to you why . and if that 's not confusing enough for you , feast upon this nugget of dialogue , from a conversation between michael and ellen brody . ellen : why did you come out here ? why did you come out here ? michael : mom ! mom ! why did you take the boat ? ellen : it [the shark] kept coming ! michael : do n't you realize what you 're doing ? ellen : i 've tried to tell you , there was nothing else to do ! michael : mom , you should n't have done it . ellen : i 've tried to tell you , i 've tried ! joseph sargent 's directing is terrible ; it 's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing . which may be why the acting is so horrible . the highlight of the cast is lance guest , whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented michael caine 's by a longshot . the horrid acting is forgivable , however ; after all , how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd ? a film in which sharks roar , swim from new england to the bahamas to kill family members , and leap thirty feet out of the water ? on the plus side , jaws : the revenge is enormously fun to watch , thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity . it is very likely one of the worst films ever made - jaws 3-d looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there 's nothing else on tv some late night , grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is jaws : the revenge	2
200 american is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy . even though it looks like a no-budget episode of queer as folk or intended to be a gay version of pretty woman , it 's got a pretty good story . it does n't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography . most of the actors are straight playing gay roles . i was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show , something that i can certainly relate to . the acting is acceptable but not great , because most of the actors are not that experienced . i was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer ! the movie has some kind of charm about it , perhaps it 's because it 's so sincere and gimmick free , and even the love scenes are very low-key . i was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss . there is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor , it 's very captivating . sean matic did a good job with his light austrilian accent by the way . it 's worth rental fee for sure .	2
hands down the worst episode of the masters of horror television show . it 's dull , boring , and not scary . it will leave you scratching your head saying " that 's all ? " do n't even bother with this dvd . it 's a waste of your precious time .	2
noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his , yours , and mine - the united states of america . he has made millions of dollars teaching , lecturing , selling his books , and investing . his world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved . his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u.s. , in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states . he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy . he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism , when he always ranks the u.s. and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now , and even in history . his distrust of any authority , benign or otherwise , is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the " underdog , " even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah . yet since 1955 , hypocrite chomsky has worked for the " overdog " massachusetts institute of technology , which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction , and continues to this very day . chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state . if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money , earning the adulation of the american left , and freedom to express himself , he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea , iran , or syria . let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much , the united states of america . god bless america , which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak , teach , and make lots of money . raybo	0
it sounds like a good system if it worked . you cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have : a wireless computer network , or a cordless phone ( 2.4 ghz ) , or a microwave that is running . i 'm not kidding - i ca n't believe this even passed testing . i think mobicam has a newer system that you should investigate owning . those have lots of reviews . pay attention to them	1

be warned , this product does not support all advertised features on all phones . right out of the box i found it did not support 2 of our 4 cell phones . of the phones that it did support , the only sync features available were photo downloading and calendar sync . the ability to transfer other data such as movies , contacts and ring tones were not available for my particular phone . without all of the advertised features are available i consider this a complete waste of money	5
this comedy , like click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through . the characters in this film can be hated at points , especially michael douglas ' and matt dillon 's but there is a lighter side ! owen wilson is very likeable as dupree , an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job . the cast is fine and one of the strength 's in this film ! however , i think it gets too serious at points . this is supposed to be a comedy after all . i would n't buy it but it is certainly worth renting	2
this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts	4
i love the smell of an essential oil in the air . i 've tried tealight burners , a smear on a low-burning lamp , and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy . the pearlessence spa mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time . because i live in a humid climate , i was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture . the cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air . the light show of the base can be turned off , but i like it most of the time . product was offered for $10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain , and shipping was free with my order over $25 with other products .	3
i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times . last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed . i have n't changed anything or done anything . i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera , but given the price i 'm pretty annoyed and amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
just as it advertised , it is soft and dries up hair and body quickly . i bought it because it was on sale and thought why not try it out , well , i am sold on this product . only drawback now is the high price tag. .	3
this book was someone else 's bookclub selection , and i think having no expectations when i picked it up really helped in my having that wow experience that some folks report with this book and others miss . yes , the prose needed much better editing : overuse of repetition , " stock " phrases , and " hanging " assertions that should have been cleaned up . however , i found the discussions of brain development / evolution , similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors , development of language in different animals , and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating ( oops , just gave away the ending ! ) . i found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening . i also liked dr. temple 's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions . great idea ! although the book really goes all over the place , i found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my " seeking / hunting " motivation ( you 'll have to read the book for that one ) , and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold	0
neither my husband or i could get into the movie . i dont think i would ever watch this film again . it was not what it was made out to be	2
i purchased this disk along with others to play in my acura dvd-a system . i found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit " over the top " with surround effects . major vocals coming from rear speakers , etc. i also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk . in fact , the demo disk for my tl has the marvin gaye song " let 's get it on " and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection . if you are looking for dvd-a disks with 5.1 surround...i 'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the cd of this album .	4
everything was excellent . the digital camera , the delivery . thank you a lot ! ! ! !	1
had i read these reviews before buying this , i probably would n't have purchased it . but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked . i did n't ask if there was a certain model that he recommended , so i assumed i 'd have to pay from $40- $150 for a sonicare . when i saw this one for $30 at target , i figured i did n't have much to lose . i 've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist could n't get . it turns off automatically after 2 minutes , so i know that i 'm brushing my teeth longer . one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it 's going...you 'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! :d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush ! ! the only negative is that it goes thru 2 aa batteries about once a month , but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that 's about right . i 've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems .	3
i love canon products and i have had a complete canon system for about 10 years . i love everything canon does . however i do not understand canon 's reasoning behind producing this lens . the reason for the ef-s lenses is offering wider angle by getting the rear elements of a lens closer to the " film " plane . they cannot do this on film and full frame sensor cameras because the mirror is larger and would hit the rear elements of an ef-s lens . they have indicated , however , that by 35 mm that advantage is gone . why then do they produce a 60 mm macro lens when they already have their macro requirements covered with they current three lenses ? i would guess that the short back focus makes the lens cheaper ; but this lens is only $60 short of the excellent 100 f2.8 usm macro . as i said , if for $60 i can get a lens that has 40 mm more reach ( 66 in 1.6crop cameras ; useful in macro photography ) and that works on all canon cameras , i 'm not going to be thinking about this lens at all . granted , you might not be thinking of buying a ff camera anytime soon , but canon has indicated that eventually they will have ff on all their dslr 's , so why bother with this lens ? the 17-85 or 10-22 are very reasonable offerings for the ef-s lineup , but the 60mm macro does n't make any sense to me . my $0.0	1
i usually do n't do album reviews but i gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call & quot ; the sauce&quot ; so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings . word of mouth is bliss . a-g-2-a-ke who came out on rap-a-lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic . i 'm salty they did n't & quot ; make it&quot ; because this was heavily slept on	4
it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w.b	1
i have tried many brands of soy shakes , and this one is delicious. . i sure recomend it to anyone that wants to start the healthy habit of drinking soy . cookies & cream flavor tastes like a real shake ! ! i really enjoy this drinks	3
i love everything about this camera but....the display is very touchy . i only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke . i had it in a case and must have bumped it just right . my display shattered . mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of . this is not covered under your warranty . my camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet . so i am sitting here with no camera , which is really bothersome since i love taking pictures . i figured i would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen ! so i highly recommend this camera but you must be very very careful with it !	1
is an product of great quality , is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1
this dude is selling info that you can learn from anyone with very limited computer knowledge . all of the same info is on the net for free . this product exists for one purpose.. . to steal from you . this pathetic thief has gone through the trouble of putting together an eleaborate scam to steal from his customers by charging their credit card 80 bucks a month without their permission . he could have used his energy and tallents to just make a good product.. . but scams seem to be his thing . avoid ! ! this is the worst company that i have ever delt with in my entire life . this john guy and anyone that works for him should be ashamed . he is an embarrasement to his company and his family . at least a mugger steals from me face to face.. . this snake is sneaky about it	5
pedometer part is fine . radio part is useless	3
i tend to like just about anything that brubaker writes . while i 'm not as excited about his marvel work as most others are , i have enjoyed his runs on captain america and daredevil . his work outside of marvel has been great ; sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years . in general , brubaker had not written anything that i genuinely disliked . then came ' deadly genesis' . in short , this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results . to what end ? another summers brother who is completely disinteresting , another story in which professor x acts like a jerk , a dead x-men ( for absolutely no good reason ) , and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years . i want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate . unfortunately , this is the second instance in which brubaker has went back and altered marvel history from long ago . in captain america , he made it so that bucky never really died in world war ii . this initially rubbed me the wrong way , but the story itself was done well , and the surrounding plots were good , so i begrudgingly went along for the ride . i was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book . his attempt to revise history does n't work nearly as well here . the key difference is that bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust . he had n't been written into any stories during all that time , so it was very easy to go and insert an alternate history for him . in ' deadly genesis ' , brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago . in order for them to work , the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward . it just does n't work . to make matters worse , none of the characters ' motivation for anything makes any sense at all . characters are keeping secrets , and other characters are upset with that , and through the whole you never understand why . it 's as if brubaker had an end goal in mind , and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point a to point b - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story did n't make complete sense . that aside , another difference between the two is simply that this series is not written as well as captain america . they overall plot does n't make complete sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly . reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment . the interior art is nice , though not great . unfortunately , the book falls so short on story alone that the art warrants almost no consideration	0
there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted . this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought . i did not do much research . i think the data may be in there , but i could not learn how to make it work . the interface is horrific - unusable . do n't do it	5
we purchased this to make sure we did n't miss anything re : stock options . the program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type , though they were not entered twice . it took me quite sometime to get them deleted . it also said we had to pay estimated tax next year-which is n't true since we overpaid ( as we have always done ) . too many errors for a tax program	5
...and i can remember some of the scenes to this day ( i 'm 49 now ) . i was 16 ; my friend , 17 at the time . i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days , and after that movie , i didn't -for a long time . at the time it was a really scary film , and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story , which only added to the starkness of it . of course , as some have opined here , what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas . " horror-and-brutality technology " in films has definitely-and i use this word wryly-evolved	2
i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches . i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed . it is easy to use in fact , i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches . its f2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge . if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you .	1

i 've worked with pinnacle studio versions 8.0 , 9.0 , 9.4. , 10.0 , and this one . and they 've all had two things in common : 1. when the program works , it 's superb . 2. the other 50% of the time , it crashes frequently , and hard . for years , pinnacle had designed the market 's top , novice-affordable video editing / authoring platforms , but for some frustrating reason , they just ca n't seem to keep the bugs out . studio plus v10.5 is no exception . lately , the competition in this market has mushroomed , and there are better alternatives available for the same price . at last , others have emulated the pinnacle platform while eliminating the work / creativity-killing bugs . my advice ? shop around . google the competition . but save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything pinnacle	5
studio album released in 1971 , by the original band-a real band with alice cooper , neal smith , dennis dunaway , michael bruce , and glen buxton . i think the other band members ( apart from cooper ) , got the short end of the stick . this album , along with these ' love it to death ' , ' billion dollar babies ' , and ' love it to death ' are so vastly superior to ' his ' other albums . the band plays and writes really well together as a ' real ' band . case in point , listen to ' dada ' from a few years later-dreadful ! just wish he had kept a proper band together , even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians . rock is about feel , more than technique in my opinion . i ca n't even listen to ' dada ' or	4
every once in a while you come across a product that does just what you wanted it to . the snapstream remote is one of them . i just recently built a home theater pc through which i play music and movies . however , the htpc is in a different room than my projector and i needed a way to operate the pc remotely while in the theater room . i chose the snapstream remote for this function and have been well pleased . i also highly recommend the snapstream remote for those people using or looking to use the beyond tv pvr solution . i record all my favorite tv programs on my htpc in high-def and able to access them with a single click of a button via the snapstream remote . this is one product that i can recommend with no reservations	5
this camera is really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when i ended up with a rebel xt as a " loaner " while my 20d was in repair . not that the xt is a bad camera , it just does n't really compare to the 20d . the 20d has a nice feel to it ; it is fairly large , which is great since i have somewhat large hands . the features are great too . and the image quality is awesome . i do n't really need to go into all of the details , as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job . let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars . the only complaint i have about the camera is that it does n't have spot metering . the ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d .	1
this is the first review i have written in probably a few years . normally , i do n't feel strongly enough about any product , good or bad , to bother entering a review . with this new version of quicken , i have something that i feel strongly enough to write about . i have been using quicken for close to 20 years . i have built all of my finances around it . for the past 6 years , quicken has been going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i do n't see how the product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product is . no functionality has been added in the previous 6 years . what has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to quicken 's " financial partners " , and more redundant links to other , old , program features , and more white space . in return , the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous . entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds . that means , once you hit the " enter " key to complete a transaction , you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction . as little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second . obviously , time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that quicken now requires you to " downgrade " your quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version . all of this with no additional features or functionality . there is a new kid on the block that i am switching to . it is called " moneydance " . it can import data from quicken , it is fast , compact , and runs on any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os / 2. it is easier to use than quicken and the support is great . it is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30. you can actually speak to a person to get help w / out having to pay . since i have been using quicken for years , it will take a while to test mondeydance out to make sure it works properly . i am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree . so far , things are going well . then i plan to dump quicken forever . the well has run dry at quicken ; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company . obviously the people at quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want . but they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade . yet , that is what they are doing . i am absolutely positively through with quicken , and i am not coming back	5
beres has done it again . this is a great cd . i can actually say that enjoyed all 19 tracks	4
americans who ca n't name five poets will name allen ginsberg . in this case , that is good since he was one of america 's greatest poets . this book attest to this . i write this review to show disappointment in the publisher who continues to publish the collected works on the cheapest paper next to newsprint . for the next edition , i would like to see , at least in limited edition , a volume printed on quality paper which could last more than a few years before turning yellow . ginsbergs deserves better treatment	0
use it with new xerox scanner and once the correct set up is utilized , it works wonders . very satisfied	5
this remote works really well and it 's easy to create your own profiles for whatever application you use , or to customize it however you want . there is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the firefly . set up is simple and the range is good . it " just works . " the only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it 's hard to use in the dark . adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it . if it were n't for that i 'd give it five stars , and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons i would n't hesitate to upgrade	5
after buying this camera i was pleased for the most part , as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good . it 's a sleek , smooth design with minimal buttons , thus little confusion . there are 3 things , however , that i 'm not happy with . one is that it takes double a batteries , and eats them up really fast . the second thing is that there 's no secondary viewfinder , just the lcd screen . the lcd screen is large , which is great. . but this is why the battery life is so low . you ca n't turn the lcd screen off , so batteries go fast . the third and final thing i dislike about it is that there 's no ac adaptor , so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the tv , not using it to take pictures , you have to run it on batteries . that is , unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt ac plug , which is neither on the vivitar website , or anywhere else online that i can find made specifically for this camera . i 'm a little upset that it came with no adapter , as that would be so useful for a camera that eats up batteries . i reccomend rechargibles if you 're going to get this camera	1
item was received in perfect shape . it is a wonderful item and a great buy	3
pink sugar is a wonderful scent . i have received many compliments on this fragrance . its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey . it is however a sweet scent . everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it . at this price $32.14 for 3.4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that . i say buy it you cannot go wrong	3
...when you 're gearing up for suicide . this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all . i found myself suffering nightmares , fatigue , misery and paranoia . my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head . this is not a good album for the stressed , because it will just make you feel worse . i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable . when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable , after listening to it more and more i started to get more " into " it , but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in . it 's a somewhat interesting album , but it mostly just dragged me down , made me nervous , numb and hurt my head . people say this is great music . let them say what they want . give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself . kid a is just ok to me , and has n't been worth all the effort to " get into " . this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners . i do n't know , maybe i 'm missing something , but to hear some " weird " music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears , try " passengers " by u2. and thom york sings like a muppet on this album . by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit ( including pablo honey - - why are people always busting its chops ) .	4
i made the mistake of buying this light to treat my acne without first talking to my dermatologist about it . after just using it three times my acne became more out of control than it had in years- -my face broke out in places it had never broken out before . it took me two months of using medication from my doctor to get my acne under control . i would not recommend using this device unless a doctor says it would work for you	3
i 'm an amateur photographer and i use photoshop cs2 for most of my digital editing . i decided i needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that i have read on digital editing . i had to download an update of the software program before i could start using my spyder . this procedure alone took several hours because i kept getting " error " messages . i ca n't count how many times i unloaded and reloaded the program . i was eventually able to run the program , however , every time i calibrated my one year old emachine crt monitor , it left me with an orange color cast on my screen . i worked with colorvision technical support for many frustrating hours . the technical support person i was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me . they even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective . unfortunately i was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor . after several weeks of trying to get the spyder2 express to calibrate my monitor , i gave up . i just did n't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned . i really wanted it to work . i 'm back to using adobe gamma .	5
i actually enjoy it more than the matrix . check it out , i liked it , so will you	2
alliterative analogies , assertively assembled , appear aplenty , appropriately , apt and artful , absorbing attention ad infinitum . this could be a fitting summary of abish 's stunningly & quot ; now&quot ; novel , written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between kabbala and alliteration . chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter a , chapter 2 with a and b and so on until chapter 27 , when z first , then chapter by chapter all other letters , are progressively subtracted . in spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature , the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary , they may have been culled from today 's headlines : polysexually inclined thugs hide in africa after a crime spree , with the author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them . chasing after the thugs from country to country , we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite , war and genocide , corrupted burocrats and soldiers , rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air , where sparsely assembled people wollow in african indolence . all is narrated with poetic detachment , in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social , political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality : it is just that the words were limited by my artifice , reader , the author seems to smile . no harm intended . perhaps : the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974 , to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy . great art , when unhindered , relates to the whole of time , in all tenses . while amusing , abish has managed a ponderous read , which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices , inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events . attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme . and wonder : was it accidental ? & quot ; in order to be perfect , all i lack is a defect&quot ; goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet	0
i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod . come to find out , this model does not have a fluid head , meaning , if you do any panning with a camcorder , it wo n't be as smooth as you 'd probably like it to be . also , at the end of a pan the head tends to " unwind , " causing your panned image to back up a little ways . thus , i think it 's rather misleading to label this as a " photo / video " tripod . additionally , i do n't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters . finally , mine came with a few , very minor cosmetic blemishes , almost as if it were used . instead of video , i 'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount . if you want to do video , please buy a tripod with a fluid head . you 'll love it , i guarantee that . that 's why i give this one 2 stars	1
i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera . the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger . i think it 's odd , as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock . i 'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery . i do n't know whether the dock works okay , because i did n't get that far . this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one . now i have to buy another battery	1

had this for less than a month and it just stopped heating.....the only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nice.....but for the dozen times used it was not worth buying...will be returning it	3
this item did n't work very well . it was n't a close shave at all . i used it twice before my dog chewed it up . it left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it .	3
product is exactly what you would expect . i have been using it for 2 months 3-5 times a day with great success . i would buy it again knowing how well it works	3
they changed pretty much everything . for starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as file , tool , and edit . which means you ca n't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access . well maybe you can , but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of office ( and almost all other pc programs ) so much easier to use . you basically have to use the mouse for everything . and in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over-mousing . the ribbon is just awful . first of all it 's huge . it takes up about four times the space of my customized toolbar . they place nearly every button imaginable on it . and as far as i can tell you ca n't change it around or simplify it . every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not . which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck . you can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice . but in reality it turns what used to be simple 1-click operations into 3-click operations ( extend ribbon , spend several minutes searching for button , click button , retract ribbon ) . good grief ! what a pain . this software did n't last 24 hours on my system before i restored my old version of office . this new interface is about the most awful thing i 've ever seen on a computer . i know of certain free open source office suites that i prefer to this monstrosity . that being said i still prefer any and all previous versions of ms office to the free one . in fact i would rather be using my old wordperfect from 1995 than this *thing* that ms is trying to shove down our throats . if only i had n't thrown that disc away six years ago.. . before you " invest " your money in this software i strongly recommend you download the free trial version . then buy an earlier version	5
i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books , but this one seemed too far-fetched . i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it . many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release	0
many have seen this movie on tv many times . for a b-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch . no extras on the dvd . i wish they did add something from behind the scenes , etc	2
this is my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i did a lot of research before i bought this and it was highly rated in consumer reports . after a few months of ok pictures ( the macro setting is not very good though ) the lens cover started sticking but i learned to live with it . i would manually open up the lens cover each time . then the lens cover got stuck in the open position and i was learning to live with that . but now the camera is almost completely dead . it will not power up properly and sometimes it beeps . i 'm not sure but i think i am out of the warranty period with this . i will not buy another canon camera . this camera was made too cheaply . i wish things were not made to break right away	1
yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse	4
the problem with this game starts with the introductury movie.. . it develops slowly , goes on forever , suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play . once game play finally does start , my child found the games boring and the transitions between the games tediously slow . cute characters...zero edutainment . it was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day	5
i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f / 1.8 mark i ( the version with the metal mount and distance scale ) that i purchased recently . canon specs the discontinued es-65 hood for this lens . the great thing about this et-65iii is that it is longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full-frame or 1 / 6-frame slrs . the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked , providing a bit more light absorption . i 've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college , but this hood is definitely worth the investment : well built , fits backward on the lens for storage ( but too long while the lens is on the camera ) , and provides good protection for the front of the lens ( it 's quite deep ) . note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f / 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount with no distance scale )	1
i recently re-read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival 's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder . drawn from sir thomas north 's 1579 english version of plutarch 's lives , william shakespeare ( 1552-1616 ) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career , around 1607 , and published it in the first folio in 1623. it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers , roman military leader , marc antony , and the captivating queen of egypt ( and former mistress of julius caesar ) , cleopatra . when his wife , fulvia unexpectedly dies , antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister , octavia . of course , this news enrages passionate cleopatra . she vents her anger on the messenger , but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty . however , antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra 's arms , abandoning his new wife in athens . this leads to war , when octavius declares war on egypt . after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria , cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide , which prompts antony to wound himself mortally . antony dies in his lover 's arms , and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar ( octavius ) , the heart-broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs . in the end , antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes . it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next . g . merritt	0
this is a nice case , however , i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends . this case is bulky and my panasonic fxo1 would fit into something much smaller . i ended up going with a great case that i found at wal-mart for a cheeper price , sleeker design , small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town	1
it is n't very user friendly . i have other software that is much easier ( adobe photo shop ) . this one will take some time and effort to get used to and work with .	5
i just ca n't say enough good things about the brainy baby series of videos and toys . i have allowed my baby to watch one brainy baby video per day since he was about 6 months old . he loves them . and i love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen . : ) as soon as the brainy baby theme music comes on he starts to smile . he is captivated . i like them much more than the baby einstein videos . and the toys.......he loves them . " hello , brainy baby ! " they are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box . i have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time . we love brainy baby at our house .	2
easy to install and get started . i purchased it to manage my digital photo 's and not to do sophisticated picture editing or enhancements for publishing . it 's been easy to use for my purposes . if you are planning on doing professional level editing or graphic manipulation , do more homework on the robustness of this product . i ca n't comment on it 's capabilities for that purpose	5
i cannot agree with any person who gives this over 1 star . the main problem i had with this product was that it was far too overpowering in the fragrance department . i swear , it was like bathing in gatorade . and while i 'm sure that axe was going for that whole electrolyte thing in all its glory , but the smell is far too fragrant . and if you think that it has even the slightest bit of an invigorating quality , think again . i was a lot happier with snake peel	3
i 've used cad programs written in the 80 's that are better than this . i 'll go back to drawing board 1.0 over this thing . not user friendly . i can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing . jun	5
i rate ( green tea fat burner ) 5 star . because i bot another called lipoxinol 70.00 ) and i bot another one called ( green tea fat furner ) and it was better in quality wise and its only 14.99 at costco . lipoxinol is very good as well but more expesive . bot off amazon.it sais its ( made canada ) derctions say to take 4 pills in am & 4pills pm . and man there great . the ( green tea fat burners ) in comparison dictions say take 2 pillsam & 2pills pm . i over rall i think ( green tea fat burner ) makes me a little bit more hyper . the more hyper the more stuff i do , that means the more excerise i get , , , , , you will see lipoxinal on amazon . its 4 star , this one has less rating for some reason , not many people said much about it , wierd , americans like to pay more money when , this one can work just as great , not all work tho , but like i said this one was great for me in wise , i bot both , dont go off telling every one u are taking weight loss pills because people will get worryed , like theres no problem , people drink coffee every day of there life , i told my mom and she thot i was crazy , but what dose my mom know , she never tryed weight loss pills , i tryed ntoher one from the natral food store call mini skiny fat burner and i felt like i just shot my self with cocane , so be carfull , earbs have been used for thousand of years and can make u drug crazy ,	3
looked at them all and then bought this software.. . it can do a lot of things so , yes , it might take a bit to learn and get fast with . there is a reason it has been voted best for several years now . it does a good job if you remember the very old computer saying , " garbage in...garbage out " 8 - ) my wife loves the video tutorials that she can pop-up anytime she needs to without stopping the software and what she 's working on . anything this complete , is worth the learning curve	5
i had a very old version of hallmark studio , do n't even remember how old . wanted to update . i installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features . lots of cards to choose from , very very pretty colors . the event planner is great too ! the only thing i would change is the ability change font in the planner , and move written info by tabbing . otherwise it 's a wonderful program . highly recommended ! ! satisfie	5

i 'm new to web design . i 've tried other products , including frontpage , and found them too cumbersome to use and the results were not what i wanted . dreamweaver is the best . easy to use , with more tools to make your web pages look great , even for a beginner . and there is a lot of support and tutorials on the web to help you out	5
as a huge counting crows fan , i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that i listened to the cd . it is nearly impossible to get through . the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke . i rated it one star because there 's no " 0 star " option . if you have any intentions of buying this cd , find a website where you can preview it first , and thank me later	4
i really did some research on digital cameras , even tried out a sony , but the canon brand is by far one of the best . i do n't have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera , it does most of the work ! i like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not iso , aperature , and all that jazz . the settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true . the digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry . there are so many features on this camera , too many to list . i even found a great deal at best buy on a 2 gig memory card , i get over 1 , 000 photos with a high resolution ! it takes alkaline batteries , but i bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time . i am sooo happy with this camera , i take it with me everywhere , even a couple of days to work .	1
some products lead to real improvement of your skin ( retin a , exfoliators ) while others simply cover up the imperfections acting like a make up . the sad and hillarious thing is that most consumers mix up makeup effects with real skin improvement . the regenerist contains silicones that fill in small wrinkles and mattify the skin surface thus acting like an invisible makeup . such effects lead most consumers to believe their crow 's feet are smaller . if you really want to do a test , you should stop using the product for a few days using only face wash . if during that time you observe smaller wrinkles then the product works . you ca n't really claim the wrinkles are smaller while the product is on your face covering them hello... . and another thing , a wrinkle ca n't be erased in one or 3 weeks - the skin does n't produce collagen that fast ( unless you cut it ) . paying $18 / 1.7 oz ( retail price , its cheaper on amazon but you have to pay shipping price ) for a silicone makeup is a little steep for me provided that there are cheaper products on the market that will make your skin look equally good cause they contain the same silicone base even better - try monistat soothing care - chafing relief powder gel 1.5 oz , $7 at cvs . i have been using matrixyl ( the active peptide in regenerist ) for 6 months in my own formulations ( without silicones ) and frankly speaking have n't noticed any improvement in my crows feet or the lines on my forehead . currently there is only one study of the effects of matrixyl conducted by sederma - the manifacturer of matrixyl which makes me quite suspicious about the whole story ...	3
i 've tried for literally the last 6 years to find a way to straighten my hair ( and have it stay straight ) ! i am happy to say that i 've finally found something that works ! i 've had many different straighteners , and this one is by far the best . i have long curly hair , and this straightener gets it done in about 20 minutes . much better than the hour i 'm used to . plus , the straightening lasts . my hair stays completely flat all day , instead of curling up on the ends like it did with my other straightener . you simply ca n't get better than this !	3
i was just given this set - new - and was impressed by the reviews . i 'm not sure if it 's just my hair , but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer . i figured i needed to work out the kinks and give it another try . again same look and that 's all the curl i have after 20 minutes . concept is good - just does n't work on my fine , full head of hair . if you want curl stick to the hot rollers .	3
this product is worthless . save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else . i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank . i 'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in	3
it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs - - this hood . how can you pay $75 for a great prime lens , and $25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
although the compartments seem small , you can fit lots of food into this bowl . it 's divided into about 4 or 5 sections , so you can separate your veggies , meat , etc. the only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break : ( so , i use it to store food in the fridge . i have all of the other fit & fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken .	3
well after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books .after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables .it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures .if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it.the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented	0
i bought this cd after i 'd watched the movie the first three times . the music is wonderful . i bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - " i do n't care to stay here long " and i want it played at my own funeral way out there in " someday " . you ca n't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the cd than in the movie . but just in case , here 's the first foot-stompin ' verse : fare - - well , vain world ! i 'm going home . my savior smiles and bids me come and i do n't care to stay here long . bright angels beckon me away to sing god 's praise in endless day and i do n't care to stay here long . right up yonder ! christians , away up yon-der . oh , yes my lord , for i do n't care to stay here long	4
i 'm more than satisfied with this scale . i was concerned that i would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy ( see reviews of other digital scales in this price range , ) but i 've tested it several times over several days , and my weight varies by 2 pounds or less over the course of the day . my first weigh-in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings , sadly . the neutral color ( grey ) and glass would blend in well with just about any decor , and the lcd screen is easy to read , with 1.5 inch high numbers . the only thing i do n't like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when i step on it , even though i 'm nowhere near its 330 pound maximum load . that problem is in my head more than in the scale : i do n't think it 's going to break , but it sounds like i 've got two people standing on it at once- -i 'm not that fat , am i ? an added feature is that when i 'm craving , i go into the bathroom and look at it , and know that it is n't going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning . so the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge . the scale has intimidated me into not eating it . accurate , easy to read , easy on the eyes , and intimidating- -i think it 's a good deal	3
darren aronofsky 's movies are beautiful masterpieces . from " pi " to " the fountain " , going through " requiem for a dream " , they will forever stand as timeless jewels . so they are hard to top in any way , but clint mansell has been able to do it every single time , scoring each of them . for " the fountain " , he teamed up once more with kronos quartet and had scottish post-rock band mogwai join in too , to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove , in a very organic way . the central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses . the combination of the talents of mansell , the quartet and mogwai yields a relatively dark , yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score	4
coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small " mom and pop " screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " did it " for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and " look and feel " , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit / create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's " make clipping mask " function . the ability to customize / edit / add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly	5
i enjoy using encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information . i use it in conjunction with britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information . i do prefer the interface and ease to britannica 2007 but the quality of information on britannica is always to be trusted . my advice you need to buy both	5
i was purchasing rockin ' wheels ( the one with the train and fire truck ) for my son , and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together . we borrowed the rockin ' wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much , i thought it would be good to have two different ones . however , the truck adventures is not as good , and my son does n't even ask to watch it . the songs are lame and so is the narrator . do n't bother	2
it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores.i do n't know what you mean by give your review a titl	3
this album was one of my biggest " mistakes " ( bought it 3 years ago ) . it 's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band . better you buy instead : up the bracket ( the libertines ) or some strokes-stuff. .	4
every one is obbsessed with " hips do n't lie " . do n't they relize that the songs horrible . well , so is every other track on this album . save your money to waste on something that is atleast some what decent	4
the camera worked fine ; however , after six months , it stopped working . i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism . my use was in no way abusive . i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage , until i gave it away . i guess i should have stayed with canon . i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight , but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
by reading the cover i thought it would be a great product to have . it indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without . games - bowling game is actually a teaser version . you can play only two lanes . others cost you extra . two other games are not exciting . themes and screen savers are mediocre . i liked the analog convertor but not too much . if you can get input from any audio device , this program can convert it into a digital format . alas it does n't convert to mp3 format . also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast , but not on the normal speed . dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions . i liked ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing . bottom line - i do n't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week .	5
i found this product to represent extremely poor value for money . i purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials . however , i have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials . this product only covers the basics ( levels 1 & 2 ) . then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels . i have since purchased a cheaper ' tell me more ' package ( for spanish ) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it . they have packed so much more value into their package . and it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level . i think it 's really disgusting that rosetta stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it . i think it borders on being a scam	5
i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it 's year of release , 1986. prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of " purple rain , " both the film and the soundtrack . and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal , which is what they did to prince in those days . many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip . they could n't believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself . it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that is n't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy . of course , poor critical response alone does n't usually keep the public from making a movie popular . yet " under the cherry moon " was a bomb at he box office . probably the main reason for this is that the movie , although shot in color , was released in black-and-white . for some unfathomable reason , the general movie-going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black-and-white movie . now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves . i 'm only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color . i will acknowledge that this movie 's target audience is prince fans . since i am one myself , and have been most of my life , i 'm not the most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies for my love of this movie . it 's not a " guilty pleasure " for me , because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites . i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release - and unfotunately i missed it in theaters ( i could n't get anyone to take me , i was only 12 and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents - though my dad went with me a few years later to see " grafitti bridge " on opening night , but that 's for another review ) . but since it 's dvd release in 2004 , this has become one of my most-watched discs in my collection . the soundtrack is killer , the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever . there 's even some great stuff heard in the movie that did n't make the album ( some of which was issued on 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think the movie looks great - the cinematographer was michael ballhaus , who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit ( and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how the movie would feel in color , but i do think black-and-white was the right way to go . even though the movie is set in then-contemporary times , it has the feel of something from the ' 30s . there are so many classic moments in this movie , i wo n't try to list them all . but here are a few.. . christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ...tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath...christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery...the " wreka stow " scene...the car race between christopher and mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . as for the acting , i 've heard a lot of people saying that prince 's performance was no good . i do n't see much truth in that claim . after being so serious in " purple rain , " it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this . jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side ( as in " purple rain " ) - i 'm surprised jerome has n't done much additional acting outside of prince movies . and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this , her first major role , to become an oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how is the dvd presentation ? pretty good , for such a largely overlooked movie . the widescreen transfer and 2.0 stereo mix are n't anything phenomenal , but get the job done nonetheless ; the movie looks and sounds fine . as for features , anyone expecting a full-blown special edition like the 2-disc " purple rain " will be disappointed . but at least it 's not a completely bare-bones release - four music videos are included , though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio / visual quality ( though they are passable , i would 've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . the highlight is the live performance of " anotherlover " which was taken from a never-released ( at least not domestically , not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u.s. ) concert video documenting the parade tour . mtv held an interesting ( i.e. - very weird ) contest to determine where " under the cherry moon " would have it 's world premiere . the ten-thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere , which would be held in their hometown . mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party - and unlike the premiere of " purple rain " unfortunately this program is not to be found on " under the cherry moon " ' s dvd release . lisa barber was the contest winner , and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan , wyoming - a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere . when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan , prince summed it up with a single word : " purple . "	2
i was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but i am so glad i did . this one gives me a really good shave . i have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since . another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud , which it is but since you turn it on and leave it , i just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem .	3
this is a very capable program that has too many nuances . for just a simple dvd burn it is far to complex . definitely for the advanced user , i am sorry that i spent the money	5
office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions . the program was stable , for me at least , and the new interface was very nice . it may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface . one thing that keeps in mind is that it uses a different file format from previous versions by default . there is the option of changing the format to the previous version but the default option is n't compatible with earlier programs	5
did not work at all . i used cheaper products that i bought from walgreens and walmart that reduced the razor bumps but not completely eliminate them . since princereigns promised to be a miracle product , i bought it in hopes of completely eliminating the bumps but it did't even reduce them . complete waste of money	3
bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error ( appears like the shutter never opens ) and will not record video . spoke with jvc and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in . will update my rating after i see what is wrong , if they can fix it , if they will stand behind their product . watch for more details . before it failed only complaint i had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price	1
i 've been using this for the last 3 months and i 'm a very satisfied customer . i get a very close shave , and no razor bumpors . i 'm afircan american and my beard is coarse and curly , sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown hair problems . i highly recommend this , because it 's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as braun and norelic . it 's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil . i cam across these because the only time i would get a great shave was at the barber . when he used clippers on me i 've never had any problems with ingrown hair , therefore i decided to own my own pair of clippers . i 'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming	3
broke after two uses . not worth the time to put back together	3
...that you simply have to see , " mrs miniver " being one , a little known film dealing with a fictitious german invasion to a sweet english village , " went the day well ? " and this film . why so ? because all 3 were made at the start of the war ( early 40 's ) when england stood very much alone in the fight agaisnt hitler and aggresive facism . invasion fears were rife , the war effort looked hopeless at times as in europe , hitler opposing country after country fell to the german aggressors ( not to mention the rampage going on in africa at the hands of rommel aided by the italian forces under mussolini 's instruction ) . england 's small island identity stood alone and under threat and was bombed , starved and demoralised into feeling invasion could happen any day . it was quite possibly the darkest of times in english history and these three films capture the flavour of that dispondancy but equally the might of the will to survive and protect , with realistic perfection . in which we serve does this more personally as we know it is based in truth and the characters become dear and well rounded quite quickly , inspiring us to care about these folk from many walks of british life . for a modern audience it may seem a little over stoic and sentimental at times but place the emotion in context of the year it was made ( 1942 ) , and i guarantee you will view it an aching sense of fear and hope which was precisely coward 's plan . an absolute gem and a must see , i weep every time i watch it	2
i wanted to give this cd as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie . i listened to it first to make sure the quality was good . i was so surprised when all i heard was music and no words . although the music is nice , i know she would not be too impressed . we had seen the movie together and we loved mr. ray 's song and wanted to know the words . it 's too bad that i 'll have to return or sell it	4
this book of eight stories by virginia woolf shows virginia 's mind at work demonstrating her & quot ; stream of consciousness . &quot ; each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life . for example , & quot ; the mark on the wall&quot ; questions the meaning of life and existence . & quot ; an unwritten novel&quot ; is about what people hide and what you do n't know about a person you seat next to on an & quot ; omnibus . &quot ; all these stories will make you look at life in a slightly different way	0
i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the " old edition " , but judging by " look inside this book " , this new english-language edition incorporates much material from the old . incidentally , the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware , apparently his taken orthodox name , while timothy ware is his original , given name . in sweden , the swedish translation of " the orthodox church " is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church . apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history . it also contains chapters on theology and worship . in my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history . its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire , under islam , and in russia both before and during communism . of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic-orthodox split , usually dated to 1054. the author believes that the so-called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . however , the book must also be read with some reservations . the author is , after all , an orthodox christian himself . its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . for instance , ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . at other times , he is surprisingly " liberal " for an orthodox . for instance , he paints mehmet fatih , the muslim conqueror of constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian . even so , " the orthodox church " remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over-view of this remarkable christian church .	0
when i got this pedometer , i found that the instructions were n't clear . i never did get the thing to work . i have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate . this one wasn't . the pedometer does n't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost . it 's just easier to buy a new one . however , i suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store	3
i stumbled across this little gem by accident . i was picking up supplies at office depot and they had a kodak z650 ( display model ) on sale for under $100. it was a ridiculous impulse buy- -i already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing i needed was another camera ! but what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be ! it 's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old olympus c-740. i had never seriously looked at kodak cameras ... i always steered clear of them based on bad press and negative comments about them from my friends who are " serious " photographers . but i could n't be happier with this little bargain ... it basically serves the need i wanted to fill - - a 6mp camera that takes the kind of quality shots i was used to with my c-740. there are a few negatives in that it can be a little slow in processing the shots , but there is very little shutter-lag when taking the shots . i 've gotten some amazing birds-in-flight shots with it- -something i 've never been able to accomplish with any of my other cameras , including the c-740. some low-contrast shots come out a bit noisy , but for the most part the shots are very crisp and sharp . it handles low-light settings better than any of the others in this class that i 've tried . at less than a third of the price of my canon s2-is , this little camera outclasses the others by a mile . i stumbled on to a good find in the z650 ... it 's not going to give you dlsr quality photos , but no point-and-shoot will . this camera is perfect for any one who likes to take great outdoor and wildlife shots . i just wish someone would have given a good report on kodak cameras before i spent a small fortune on the others	1
i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool , but ended up disappointed . they definately oversell it as an interior design tool . looking at the brochure online , i really think they must have touched up the images , because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product . as a matter of fact , the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that . the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great . i wish all software had that .	5
i purchased this camera for my 6 yr old daughter . it is n't even good enough for a child 's toy camera ! she had asked for a camera with a flash and screen for viewing what she had taken photos of . this camera looked like it would fit the bill . it was small and " cool " looking , had a dock ( great idea ) , li-ion battery ( great idea ) and a skin ( great idea . ) unfortunately it lacks the ability to take decent photos in varied environments ( we are not always outside in the sun ! ) if they would put a better camera in the same package it would become very desirable . save yourself the grief and buy something else . i 'm getting a 5mp hp ( for less money even !	1
like some of the other reviews , i loved cool edit pro . then adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. i use this program often and tried to give it a chance . no way around it , it sucks now . i am going to use sonar , a much better product . the only thing i like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from audition . that is the only reason why i gave it one star . this is not a user friendly program	5
yes , the kit is easy to use , but if you do n't bleed freely , get a few extra lancets before you start . most pharmacists will give you one or two lancets for free . the kit only comes with two ( which can be used only one time ) . it took me 6 jabs to get enough blood for the test ; i had to run out to the corner pharmacy to get more lancets ( because i 'm too much of a whimp to find a household bloodletting tool ) . other than that - no complaints . the lab got the results back to me faster than expected	3
of little or no use - much to difficult to use when you are excercising - i find this product totally unacceptabl	3
it could happen to you was a bit of a disappointment , considering the makeup of the cast : nicolas cage , bridget fonda , and rosie perez among others . the movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the ny state lotto , decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day . the acting is surprisingly ( ! ) below average , the dialogues are way below average , while the plot is not bad at all . nicolas cage 's character is too naive and too slow , and that was just sad / pitiful ! bridget fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland . rosie perez 's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring and annoying very early on . as for wendell pierce and stanley tucci this film does not seem to be their thing ; they do n't seem to belong . subsequently , they are not convincing in their roles at all . finally , somebody shoot the " narrator , " please ! though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off . a shame really.. . no masterpiece here . if nicolas cage is what you had in mind , check out the amazing movies city of angels and / or the family man .	2
no support . you have to pay $9.95 to send an email support question . still cannot print annotations in pdf files that you create . there is a workaround . nuance should change their name to nuisance . i hope that someone comes up with an alternative	5
some of the songs here are good , most notably " never be forgotten " .....beautiful . i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing . herein lies the problem . the song is good , the voice is good . but if she sounds like faith or martina , there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there . add to this that this is mostly bubble-gum pop and not country....there 's really nothing that stands out here . why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there ? that 's the question .	4
encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta - 2007 it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks , like the newest videos . recommend at least 1 gb of ram and a pentium 4 processor with a newer video card ( 2 yrs or better ) for the best video viewing it will run on older system	5
i love them ! i have a fairly expensive 6 piece lithograph and each piece is about 15 lbs . we were not only able to hang them with minimal damage to the drywall but have them almost perfectly abutting each other	3
i just sold this back through amazon , i was so disapointed with it . it 's an all cover record , and while greg duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers , all of the music feels too subdued , too flat . duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the whigs and the first twilight singers recording .	4
i 'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you : this cd is not like the other putumayo cds . no , it is not fun , hip , relaxing , good to dance to , or stimulating . it is a selection of hackneyed sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices . i have this rule for music : if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta , it sucks . consider yourself warned . if you like good music , try french cafe instead	4
i 've had this digital camera for almost a year . it 's the fourth camera i 've owned . i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere . being an amateur photographer ( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others ) , i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera . it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse ( for formal nights out ) . the size and weight of this camera is its best feature , and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera , too . this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on-line to landscape scenery . my pictures have always turned out beautifully , with wonderful color and crispness . i have discovered that the " automatic " lighting feature is not always the most ideal , but you can re-program just about anything on this camera . it 's really quite a good camera , and given its price these days with the newer generations out there , it 's a steal	1
i discovered my ms office had a bug in it , and came that way from the factroy . i looked word over and it was clean . then the program itself . it does everything and well , and it does it without the tracking bug on it	5
this product is amazing . after learning my husband was taking me to mexico for our 25th anniversary , i was nervous about going into a foreign country without knowing any spanish . this game is amazing . it is the fastest way to learn a language without the long drawn out grammar explanations . afterall , i just wanted to learn the basics , phrases for restaurants , banks , airports , shopping etc. this game was so much fun , you could n't tear me or my husband off the computer . we kept wanting to play because learning was so much fun . the phrases i learned contributed to a much more enjoyable trip and now i have enrolled at the local community college to further my spanish . this product is perfect for any one travelling and wanting to learn the phrases and colloquial expression fast	5
i bought this for my 3 children who are already taking computer classes in middle school . the license allows you to install it on 3 computers so for $130 its a great deal considering that a single license of a full version of office is couple hundred	5
i tested numerous anti-virus programs after getting fed-up with previous norton anti-virus , which would always " hang " my incoming email , causing me to redownload larger files and sometimes make it impossible to retrieve them at all . ( incidentally , this had nothing to do with the " time-out " settings . ) after testing other top rated anti-virus programs , the only one that would n't " hang " large email files , was kaspersky . even though i have my " time-out " set to only 1 minute , kaspersky never stumbles and lets go , even if it takes much more than 1 minute to download . i also like the easy to use " pause protection " when i 'm doing file clean-ups , because there 's no sense passing temporary files through a second time , and it speeds the clean-up 5 times faster	5
the edward scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores . i truly believe this is danny elfman 's best score and believe me , he 's done some great scores ! the music is so moving . the childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet , beautiful film . even people who have n't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials . a must-have for any danny elfman and / or tim burton fan	4
this pad barely got warm . it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried , i suspect it is n't defective but intentional.. . probably for legal reasons . but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it ? ?	3
this product is not even directionally accurate . it said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual . then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat . perhaps we had a lemon , but i am taking this back because it is very inaccurate . in fact , this is the first review i have ever written because i want to warn people about this product . please do not waste your money	3

having used turbo tax since 1990 i feel that i am qualified to comment on it . i have also used quicken , quicken deluxe , quicken home & business , quickbooks pro 2003 & quickbooks premier contractors edition . the turbo tax product seems to get more user un-friendly each year . the navigation features do not allow as much mobility thru the program as they did in the late nineties and early 2000's . like i said i was using quickbooks pro 2003 until tax time last year . i purchased turbo tax home & business like i had for the past 4 years , and really got a shock when i found out that it would not import my data from quickbooks pro 2003. three year old software that was not compatible with turbo tax in 2006 ( actually 2005 tax year ) . i ended up purchasing quickbooks premier contractors edition 2006 ( $280+ ) in order to upgrade just to get my taxes done . intuit in my opinion is a perfect example of major corporate greed . i am done with them and will purchase taxcut this year	5
the camera case only works if you wear a belt- - there is no clip on . the case itself holds only the camera , not even space for a spare battery or memory card . ( i 've heard the case will darken your camera , but i did n't end up using the case ) . the neck strap is not useful , it 's too long . at ' 34 inches , if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it . ( the canon camera rocks , however .	1
just listening to the samples of this new remix of " gold:35th anniversary edition ~ the carpenters " i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly . certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well . i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs ? as another review noticed and i agree with , is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice . this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters . the older cds ( if still in production or if you can find them used ) " carpenters classics 25th anniversary " a 2 cd disc 98:04 minute collection remastered digitally , is a much better pick . especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with . the other cd 's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen 's deep resounding perfect voice , would be the cd " voice of the heart " this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song . the other one i would highly recommend , if christmas is your holiday , would be " carpenters christmas portrait " ... " special edition digital version....celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the seasons best.. . " with karen and richard . there are 34 carpenters songs as timeless as their sound , and 11 performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time . these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing . these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard . this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter 's recorded and later remastered-not remixed - sounded . for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a 2 star rating . these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans , took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song . talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver . as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying " if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ! " or in this case do n't remix it !	4

i read the review centering on the box the dvd comes in and must admit that i was stumped as well . it was " different " but i do n't foresee this as being a problem overall . the new office ultimate 2007 loaded quickly . how quickly ? well , i had to check my new vista hp notebook because i could n't believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time . it asked for the product key and one or two other bits of data but that was it . out of all the office suites i have owned , this one loaded so quickly i was sure there was a problem . nope . access , outlook , word , powerpoint , publisher , onenote , excel , groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated ( do n't worry ; you only do it once , not for each separate program . naturally , if you are like me and totally dependent upon email , you 'll activate outlook first ) . the new office " feels " different . the ribbons are ok but i would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the classic ( xp ) view . i rely quite a bit on the research task pane and i do n't mind telling you that it was difficult to find . the menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion , at least for me . of course , finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if microsoft had put a product manual in the box ( yes , the online help is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out ) . all in all you will find all of your old favorites . and , true to the office legacy , they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but i 'm willing to bet that after all is said and done , office ultimatae 2007 will become the industry standard	5
this is one of the best-tasting energy / snack bars i 've tried . it has true flavors ( think a chewy chocolate brownie with small chocolate chips ) , little or no " off " flavors or aftertastes , and it 's relatively filling , especially if accompanied by water or an additional quick snack , such as fruit . it 's a small bar , but it 's packed with 3 grams of fiber ( 12% of daily needs based on a 2 , 000 calorie diet ) , and it 's certified 95% organic . these organic ingredients include organic rolled oats , organic oat flour , organic oat fiber , organic and milled flaxseed , and actual natural flavors . even the sweet stuff is organic : , including organic chocolate ( made with- -you guessed it- -organic evaporated cane juice ) , soy butter , cocoa powder , cocoa butter , tapioca syrup , and fig paste . clif 's website proclaims that " clif zbar is the first kids ' snack created to comply with sb-19 , california 's senate bill limiting fat and sugar in foods offered within the state 's school system...we source ingredients which do not contain wheat and are not genetically engineered . " although aimed at kids , adults and teens will enjoy this as well . ingredients : organic rolled oats , organic chocolate chips ( organic evaporated cane juice , organic unsweetened chocolate , organic cocoa butter , soy lecithin , natural flavors ) , organic evaporated cane juice syrup , organic brown rice syrup , organic tapioca syrup , organic fig paste , organic oat flour , organic cocoa powder , organic soy butter , natural flavors , organic oat fiber , organic milled flaxseed , organic chocolate ( organic evaporated cane juice , organic unsweetened chocolate , organic cocoa butter , soy lecithin ) , salt , baking soda . for those with allegies , clif includes the following caution " contains soy . may contain traces of milk , peanuts and other nuts .

it works , but it takes a long time to really trim it down . very low power , made of plastic . i do n't recommend this product	3
synopsis ( including ending ) : don ameche ( gino ) , a chicago shoe shine man , is approached by the mafia to go to jail for " 3 to 5 years " to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him . they 'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat . joe mantegna ( jerry ) takes don ameche ( gino ) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he 's incarcerated . joe mantegna is on probation from the mob , after disobeying orders from a previous job . joe mantegna goes " outside channels " to take don ameche ( gino ) to lake tahoe to the " galaxy " hotel where they stay , wine and dine , and try to have a good time . things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche ( gino ) to his house as a guest and they form a bond . the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle . they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago , joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide . " it 's cleaner this way.. . " , he 's told . joe mantegna refuses the order , and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life . the good : joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe . other than that , there 's nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge . the bad : the mob wants tough guys , right ? this is a comedy , right ? no ones a tough guy and there 's no laughs . joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy . don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality . i wanted to like this film but i coulde n't because it was very slow , very boring and none of the characters were interesting . we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet . you would expect a friendly " thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me " but it does n't happen . at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he 's testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail . he does n't look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet , he 's right there taking the fall . if the film did n't need to depend on don ameche 's appearance , why did n't they send him to jail from the beginning ? the worst david mamet experience i 've had . very surprising stinker . the characters : if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting . if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them , he would have been more interesting . as the film stands , they 're both flat . don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used . when a character says something , you can be sure don ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot . don ameche 's dialogue leaves a lot to be desired . add to that his boring and stale acting in this film . he played very dumb , not interesting , like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money . overall , joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand . don ameche was too passive and uninteresting , and joe mantegna is too passive and stale . scene criticism : a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic . ( gas station scene where joe mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for ) joe mantegna is working for the mob , and he asks for $1 of gas , and gets $4. he does n't have the cash to pay , and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is " please , please , please " a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant , take back the keys , and leave for the plane they were late for . a mob guy that wo n't defend himself for $3 ? ( scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years ) don ameche does n't put up a fight or try to leave the room , and is too passive . we do n't learn about his past or his life or family . there 's not enough time spent on the offer , and the scene was over valued for it 's lasting value . ( bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape ) joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche 's character to justify the scene . instead it 's 2 strangers . personal commentary : the test for a comedy for me is - " how many times did i laugh ? " this film never made me laugh . i 'm shocked the film costs $24.99 on dvd . rent it instead . it belongs in the $1 bin at wal-mart . writing criticism : lines like " he 's the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy " and lines like " a big man knows the value of a small coin " and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense . the writing is drivel . alternative recommended film : " trading places " with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche , albeit in a smaller role	2
i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called " mastering " . i have original un-mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set ! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go , but in all honesty , this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality . the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for . i cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close . save your money and wait	4
i 've had the a510 for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a 3.2m camera . after six months the lens and cover have jammed and i noticed that many amazon reviewers have had the same issue . one evening i took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate . i 'm hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers .	1
i have been a ronstadt fan since the early 70 's , and although the nelson riddle stage and the mexican stage were not my style , i still loved her vocal perfection . this is truly the only album i have n't played more than twice ( i did n't like it the first time , which surprised me , so i tried it again ) . it does n't showcase her voice or her talents . the songs are very ho hum . linda , put out a christmas album ( been waiting for years ) , and try to get sweetness back for this old fan	4
i really love this bible . even for someone who is well-versed in bible scripture , this adds a new dimension to your understanding . i purchased one for myself and liked it so much that i purchased one for my mom for mother 's day .	5
i loved the idea of the clapper . i live alone so the clapping sound would n't bother me and i looked forward to the convenience factor . my first clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working , but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short . did i learn my lesson ? oh , no ! i went ahead and purchased another clapper some months later . the night before last , the lamp i connected this one to started blinking . i checked the lightbulb and it was ok . it was only went i got down close to the clapper plugged into the outlet that i heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity . once again the clapper crapped out , this time in a different lamp , different outlet . will i never learn ? thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device . can you say " housefire " ? again , how dumb am i ? is the unit ul-approved and , if so , have any other complaints been lodged about it ? how does one find this out ? i like my gadgets , but " buyer beware " on this one	3
i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model . the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth . it 's a bit louder than the older model , probably because it 's got an additional motion , and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light . overall , just what we wanted	3
this product states 4 toothbrushes . that is incorrect , it only holds 3. this product also states 4 aa batteries or ac adapter . that is also incorrect . you cannot use 4 aa . i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me . if those things do n't bother you , it might be what you are looking for , but since it does bother me , i never even tried it	3
i have been a long-time radiohead fan and , like many others , have been waiting patiently for a live dvd . so i was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist . it never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old ! i could n't help being disappointed when i watched this dvd . the constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch . in fact , i only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust . i know i would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime . i 've always that radiohead was modern , progressive , and totally innovative . i appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey.. . and it does n't help that before every song , thom mutters " this is a new one .

like everyone else has said - the controls on this dryer suck ! if your fingers are at all wet or greasy from product , it is a struggle to flip the switches . i do n't know if the ionic feature did anything or not . i suppose i 'll know once i compare it to the replacement i 'm about to buy . i had the dryer for about a year...and now it 's gone . as i was drying my hair last week i noticed sparks shooting out of the nozzle ! yikes . i cleaned out the filter and the sparks stopped . it lasted maybe 3 more uses before it just went dead . no smoke , no fires , just nothing . i expect a longer life from a simple appliance like this . back to target i go. .	3

i have been a user of paperport since version 9 , skipped the upgrade to 10 because of bad reviews , received an upgrade notice in the mail , so i decided to buy it . it turns out it was a bad decision . the scanner that i use with 11 is the same as with 9 and is on nuance 's hardware compatibility list . the problem is , it took me uninstalling and reinstalling the program to get the scanner to work at all with paperport . then , when i did get it installed - and i used the advanced setup option with it , tested it , all looked good - except everytime i scan something , the program crashes ! it is literally unusable as a scanning solution . i have seen a few companies with products that were once really good , sell it off to another company , and the product support seems to be essentially abandoned . it seems that this may be the case . there are no updates or bug fixes for 11 , and i will not buy another paperport version in the future . i will attempt to go back to 9 , and probably stay with that . if i run into any issues with it over time , i will look elsewhere , and i recommend others do the same . i normally do n't write reviews for products , but this one is so poor , i just had to warn people	5
this is a great book i love it and its very interesting ! great information and pricing	0
this camera is garbage . it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money . it was hard to figure out , it took lousy pictures , it burned through batteries . avoid this camera . i just wish i could give it zero stars	1
i enjoy all the features of this item . the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure . you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off . the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear . the slot for memory cards 1-4 ( depends on the card type ) , batteries ( roomy for four aa ) , and cables can fit in it . the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy . it 's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good . the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width . it can even handle the worst environment ever . hot , dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops . it has protected my dig . camera very well	1
would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the stewart granger version of " king solomons mines " . he is alan quartermain personified and deborah kerr is a more than credible female lead . all else is dross . and while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic " prisoner of zenda " . stewart granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the dvd revolution .	2
the camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever . i have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers . we had a 10x optical , 5 mp kodak camera that worked well , it was just big and bulky , never to fit in a pocket . the 10x optical zoom on the v610 also works well , the lenses never protrude from the camera when i use the optical zoom . the viewing screen is large and very clear . the menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great . it would also make a fine camera for a beginner . the panorama function works very well also . i have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures . the camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick . i have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom , picture quality , or functionality . the lcd screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger , but do n't let that stop you from getting the camera . you will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative . my only small frustration was when going skiing , i attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10x optical zoom and the image stabilizer . it was at night and only the lights were on , the camera would n't focus on him until he was close , but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow . otherwise the video has worked flawlessly . there is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame . ( very useful ) my brother bought the panasonic lumix® dmc-tz1k , ( a very good camera also ) before i got the v610 and now he wishes he got the v610	1
i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french . the music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing . steven halpern composes great music	4
like the product very much . comfortable and convenient . i would recommend then if : you have a small hat size , do n't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag . with the above i do n't have a problem . the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed , goggle like eye pieces on warm days . i 've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye , but have not done this as of jan , 2007. i like them very innovative	3
i purchased this product in nov 2006. reviews at other sites indicated this was a wonderful product , the very best , editor reviews - not user - the product is to new i guess . i looked at the specs and it had features which looked very appealing , so i thought i would try it - bummer . acronis 10 installs fine , sets up a file system on a seperate physical drive and appears to work , until you verify the images , all are corrupted . i have contacted acronis several times , they have given me several test tools to find out what might be wrong . nothing has been resolved after 4 1 / 2 months . the tools and debuging has shown no errors in my hardware . i have to keep using ghost-2003 to do my images , it works fine . acronis support acts like its a unheard of problem , but i now find references all over the internet about this image corruption problem going back to version 6	5
and i am not just talking about weight loss products . i took one pill....one pill ! within a few minutes , i was curled up around the toilet crying because i needed to throw up so badly but i couldn't . i had n't drunk anything but one glass of water with it , and yet , i was peeing all day . i was nauseus....my fiancee stayed home with me all day to take care of me . i did n't want to move , but i would have to go to the bathroom to pee , and would carry around a trash can with me just in case i finally could throw up . i would not wish these symptoms on anyone , not even my worst enemy . that was probably the worst sickness i have ever had	3
i too read the ta for tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago . she loved it a lot so i 've been looking for it again , this time for my grand-daughter . even though the title is different from the original one i knew , i purchased it and read it as soon as i received it . bottomline : this story is _not_ the original one and i do n't like it at all . other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters ( which i can live with up to a point ) , i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch , drawn with a full-blown ugly face " who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan " . unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies . without enough warm fuzzies ( we read earlier ) it puts people " in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die " . ouch . so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women , here we have another story that villifies them ( ok , i 'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all ) . no , it 's not funny , and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child . the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are , as the original book did . too bad , for using images of " warm fuzzies " and " cold pricklies " is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children . i am returning the book .	0
i started with norton ghost 2003 many years ago and had problems backing up clone images . acronis true image backup 9.0 has a simple user interface that works well . i used it to re-image my son 's computer without any problems . it is a good product for the price . i highly recommend making a backup image of your hard drive on a weekly basis	5
i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work . when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with . unless you are going for a very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser can save the day . it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places , so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind . sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo , and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
i could n't even assemble the product , and there were no instructions on how to do so	3
i picked up the audio book from the library , and did n't know by the title and author 's name ( my first jance book ) that this was chick lit . i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known . it started real well , and ms. jance knows how to reel you in with her writing . midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor , and then about her friend who died of als , and then came the long responses to the blogs . it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama .	0
decadent stories to warm you up on a cold winters night . just the right amount of comedy and sexiness blended together for the right recipe for love . " warm and soothing , sweet and sensual , these luxurious love stories will melt your cares away , and fulfill your most delectable dreams.. . " the quote on the back of the book hits the mark . these stories all share a love of chocolate and chemistry . although the stories may seem short and rushed at times , we must remember , it is an anthology and many feel that way . each story is a nice little break from the ordinary . hope you enjoy this book as much as i did . lori foster and suzanne forster deliver their best as always	0
i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays . they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations ( in detail ) of people having sex . the book is probably very good if you like reading text books , and do n't mind these pictures , but i was just too grossed out . if you are teaching lit in college and / or studying shakespeare , this is probably the book that you should use , but you should flip through the book first ( i.e : library , book store ) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves .	0
i bought this product because i had a borderline high reading at my doctor 's office . rather than having the hassle of going to his office and paying a cop-pay just to have it monitored , we purchased this unit . it works wonderful . very simple and gives more information than i expected	3
the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use . they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on . the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me . every head is different , so maybe they 'll work better for you	3
i first saw this movie around 1980 , when the cold war was still on . i had been inundated with propaganda from birth , that all russians talked about was political , that they did n't do " normal " things or live a normal life . all politics you know . well , here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women . it was very well acted , and basically , just a long soap ! i loved it- -and not one word about lenin , marx , or anti-americanisms . i recently saw it again , and liked it just as much . for those who say it is unrealistic- -well , how do you know ? do you think that all russians lived the exact same life ? or because american cold war propaganda stated that all russians were totally miserable	2
i do n't usually like these type of movies , but this is a ca n't miss...you 'll laugh	2
to start i am a very big fan of doris day for yeays . i had just bought the 6 dvd box set of her movies & loved that so i decided to buy this tv series . it is so awful words ca n't describe it . it 's not because it 's " dated " because i love lucy is alot older & sheer perfection . it 's initially nice to see doris in another genre but this first series just does n't work for me for many reasons . the subject matters chosen are thoughtful ( that 's the reason i gave it two stars & the presence of doris ) ..i 'll tell you the show just bored me & i found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes.the dvd extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting . there 's no new interviews with doris ( that 's an old interview they put on there ) .i think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog	2
two main problems with this " cordless massager " . the first being that it does n't hold a charge for very long . you may get an hour use on a full charge , and that shows diminishing power as it goes . add to that it 's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment . if you 're looking for something to rumble a slight bit , this is for you . otherwise , save your money	3
predator is arnold s best movie from the 80s , followed by the t1 and conan the barbarian on the third place . there is an exclusive edition to be released in 2007 / sept 1 / in uk that will have a replica of predator s head in mask , something simmilar to the alien deluxe head box quadrilogy edition , it will cost about usd200 , - . check it out on amazon.co.u	2
gerry marsden and his pacemakers are great . i just want to point out that the double-cd ' best of ' import has 15 extra tracks and sells for about the same price . there is just no reason to buy this compilation instead of the import	4
i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy . it has both point and shoot , and slr features . you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography . the software was easy to use , easy to set up , and it works well on my mac . it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name .	1
this software is wonderful ! i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years . i 've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface was too clumsy , nova which was rather difficult at times ( many things you ca n't do ) and now this . when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this . i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them . but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages . i did n't get halfway through the video - i had figured out how to do it . i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i 've ever made . within hours i had a beautiful collage / letter to send with my holiday cards . my husband 's first impression was a heartfelt " it 's lovely " . what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background , i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want , i 've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it ( .png format ) . i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now . i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator , but then it probably is n't as complicated to use ( from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve ) . you can also use the eyedropper tool to " pick up " any color from any picture , background , or element ( read " anything " ) in the program . i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched ! i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches . you can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do , but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses . you can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing , etc. there are so many more features i could n't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates and do n't feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software . you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program . you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities . the great thing about this program is that it is n't just for scrapbooking . you can do all your photo manipulation in it . i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have n't been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using that version . i 'm so glad i got version 10 as it is very user friendly too . but please know that version 10 ( which comes with this package ) is not the most recent version . version 11 is out now . if you do n't want / need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having . i highly recommend the training videos on the cd - they really help	5
the only reason to rent this film is so that you can laugh at the stupidity of it . the writing was terrible , the plot so unrealistic , and the " special effects " horrible . this is by far the cheesiest and dumbest film ever made . why haley mills agreed to star in it is beyond me .	2
this smarmy kevin costner vehicle is a trite half-baked movie . i found this movie nearly unwatchable . if you 're looking for outstanding movies with a baseball theme try bull durham and eight men out	2
" modigliani " ( 2004 ) is a self-indulgent , pretentious and largely fictional portrait of a tragic artist . writer-director mick davis goes overboard on the symbolism while revealing precious little about the man and his work . ironically , the viewer has a better understanding of pablo picasso than amedeo modigliani . despite his boundless enthusiasm , andy garcia is simply too old for the title role . an irritating fiasco that deserved its straight-to-video fate	2
another film in the never-ending series of " giant animated snake eats people " films that have been plaguing us for almost a decade . the creators of a maximum-security prison in the antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile . there 's nothing more to this film than that . " boa " ( also known as " new alcatraz " ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness , which i do n't think was a smart idea . the technical team - photography , production design-set decoration , etc. - create a fairly effective , chilling atmosphere , but everything else about " boa " is strictly routine . dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable , although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife , and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard , grand l . bush , craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional . the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n't see just how fake it looks . i do n't really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other , similar titles include " python " 1 and 2 , " anaconda " ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and " anaconda : search for the blood orchid " , and the inevitable " boa vs. python " . the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors . 2 /	2
not the type of music i had envisioned...much slower than i was hoping for .	4

this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best . when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0. the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs . give or take a few from clothes.. . i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx . 20 pounds 20 pounds !	3

i bought this in august 2005 , when the original battery that came with my nikon coolpix 880 ( late 2000 ) started running down fast . on the page i ordered from , it appeared to be a genuine nikon battery , however , when i received it , it was not . it was made in taiwan , and does not have the nikon brand name anywhere on the battery ( or packaging , as i remember ) . this battery has never held a charge well . it 's about as bad as the original battery is now , and i 've only had it a few months . maybe i just got a lemon- -but i 'd recommend you buy a genuine nikon , if you can find one	1
when i first stepped on the scale i thought i lost 10 lbs . but after reading other review i realize the scale is off up to 9 lbs . also this is a big scale . too big to store in the bathroo	3
this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses . the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them . he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	3
i bought 300 and 500 units . they are not working in my small condo . i cannot find the place to see how they finally work	3
like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980 's , the pet shop boys were ahead of their time . this album was purchased mainly for " west end girls " and " it 's a sin . " play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it 's fantastic . " loves comes quickly " emerges for me as the best of the pet shop boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy . the great contributions of great britain and australia to music in the 1980 's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920 's to the early 1950 's ( no doubt the origins of some great movie scores ) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll . you will love the pet shop boys	4
with beautiful photos of the range of niki 's work , this children 's book enables both kids and adults to get an overview of niki 's work , especially her sculptures . this is the only book i have found that has pictures of her escondido work- - it is a magical place and one can get a feel for it through this book	0
aside from the typical minor quarks , this is overall a good product . i 've been using turbo tax for many years and it seems to work for me	5
well , the labels did it again . first , when they released the album " dream " on cd . their biggest hit from that album " you never done it like that " turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release . they did it again with this " ultimate collection . " that being said , i love some of their other hits , especially " the way that i want to touch you . " luckily , the rest of the tracks are the originals . if you 're looking for the original version of " you never done it like that " , you would have to get the 20th century masters collection of theirs	4
not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on . i would turn it off and on and nothing would help . finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in . this seemed to fix the problem a few times . after that i thought it was just operator error . but it wasn't . the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away . so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile . an event came up about a month later . i got my camera and tried to turn it on . nothing happened . so i changed the batteries . still nothing happened . i 'm not sure what happened . i do believe i purchased a lemon camera . i 'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung . it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time . so i guess you get what you pay for !	1
this is my favorite jazz album of all time . put simply , this was miles davis at his best . the notes on this album simply float , and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard . the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense . do n't let the thirty second clips fool you . i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading . i took a chance on it , and it was the best gamble i 've ever made . a must have for any jazz enthusiast	4
i am a novice photographer , so take this with a grain of salt.. . i just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components . i suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits , putting them together must seem self-explanatory . if you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating . it is also frustrating to discover smith victor does not have a support site ( just references on photography ) . they do not even provide a support # or address . keep all this in mind when considering something from this company	1
this book is a five star book ! ! ! ! i love it so much ! ! ! partly becuase i like mystery / adventurous books and i would recommend this to all of the people who like mystery / adventure . it is a great book about a great family when everything goes wrong when janie jonhson decides she wants to drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid - she learns too much. .	0
it is exactly the same thing as came with my camera - just what i neede	1
oh my goodness rodger , oh my goodness . just oh my gosh , i 'm just stunned . this is the crappiest pice of crap that was ever ingested and mushed into chyme . yeah , you heard me , this is chyme . ok , let 's see , let 's mix bland country ballads with all kinds of awkward pop / country crossovers... . what do we get , half-baked , half-digested stuff that is for dumb teenage girls who are massively overweight . well , they 're probably smarter than me.......... . i 'm like as smart as a fungi . no one needs to know and whose bed have your boots been under are on the right direction out of the smelly stool sample . before i get too many people wanting to massively torture me with horrible utensils i 'll say something nice . come on over was an excellent effort , with all kinds of hooks , great production ( errr , i mean it is robert " i 'm actually dead " lang ) , and all kinds of fun . up ! was even better ( i 'm not going to praise it too much , though , i mean , i am an 18 year old guy..... . so i already feel like i should be staring at a picture of kevin sorbo or something.. . which is not cool , i mean unless it 's just hero worship , i could worship kevin sorbo ) ! but still , we have this horrible , stinking , steaming mass of smelly wet clay-like pudding to shovel into the toilet ( it 's intended target ) ...... looks like someone has bad aim	4
turbotax has what looks like it would be a geat feature - - the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you do n't have to enter all of your stock sales by hand . some of the cost basis ( how much i bought the shares for ) was empty , so i had to go in and enter them manually . no big deal , just took a few minutes . however , when i went to e-file , the program had flagged these changes as " overrides " to computed values , and refused to let me e-file the return . equally bad is that if i just leave the fields empty - - as they came from charles schwab , then it looks like i got the stocks for free , and have a huge tax bill ( that is incorrect ) . so , after many hours of trying to see if i could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an " override " , i determined from other upset users of turbotax in the forums on intuit.com that i was out of luck . i 'd have to print it out and mail it in . as a special reward , turbotax does n't even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in . the help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return . that 's wrong . so , the main reason i got turbotax was to e-file . now , i get to print it out , find out all of the crap that i have to attach to the return , mail it in , then wait for weeks to months to get my return . thanks , intuit ! ! ! ! the saddest part is that h&r block had sent me a free copy of taxcut before i bought turbotax . i should have used that before i spent $30 on a piece of crap like turbotax . wo n't do that again	5
i bought three of these - - one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents . two of them stopped working . one of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped . unfortunately , out of the warranty period ! and inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored . i 'm out a lot of money for this garbage . do not waste your money on this garbage ! ! ! !	1
unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets . spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments . this is not always practical . the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off . i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product , but not yet ready for prime time	5
this omron blood pressure monitor is ok , but not as good , in my opinion as my old one from the same company . this one does n't print out results , although it does store them . also , the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome .	3
i work at best buy and we install this piece of garbage all the time . for one its a huge system hog and two it does n't catch much of the pesky spyware . also when computers come in to be cleaned up , no one uses this program ( even though we 're " supposed " to recommend it ) . i would recommend xoft , pest patrol , or ms antispyware much much more .	5
i bought this product b / c i ca n't stand the feeling of hair / stubble on my legs . i got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave . this product indicated i could remove hair in about the same amount of time , but that it would last much longer than shaving . i purchased it and waited a week to receive it . once i received it , i spent 40 minutes using it . in this time , i could have shaved both legs , both underarms , and my bikini line twice . using this product , i was not even done with one leg . i went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period , and it did not remove a single hair . i pressed lightly , i pressed hard , i did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach , and nothing made this product work as indicated . others may have had luck with it , but i did not . i was not impressed and i would not recommend it to anyone .	3
if you 've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down , visualizing it , tithing - this book offers no additional insights . and despite his & quot ; official religious disclaimer&quot ; at the beginning of the book , it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma . if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book , but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	0
pc doctor works great ! it removed spyware that other software did not . it is a memory hog and slows your computer while scanning , but it is worth the time . i turn off the software when not using the internet	5
i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet . we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case	1
i purchased two aquis microfiber , waffle , white ( 19 x 39 inches ) towels . although they are quite expensive , the positive reviews made them sound great . well , they are not . the towels are quite thin , and do not rub / slide well on the skin . they give the feeling of having a rubbery coating of some kind which makes them wad up when you rub your skin . they are the same thickness as a dish towel , so we are using them to blot the dishes when they come out of the dishwasher . save your money on this one !	3
ahh , " iron eagle " . a classic of the 1980 's golan-globus production mill . with the current spate of historic / " current " military movies , it 's sometimes good to see how hollywood 's come in trying to get the details right . one ca n't do much better than using this flick as a baseline . in case you are n't already familiar with this gem , louis gosset jr. playing a reserve air force colonel , and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country -ok i 'll name it : libya - to rescue the kid 's dad . pop gets shot-down when he 's intercepted in international waters , but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure . the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid 's challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully 's using his dirt bike . suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe ; he does n't get his slot at the usaf academy , though . you gotta take the bad with good i guess . when the words on dad get back to the family , this kid uses his base " network " to get access to imagery , enemy air defense data , and two f16s carrying a b52 's worth of ordinance . all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents , no less . ( if only strike planning was this easy . ) of course , the kid has flown training missions with his dad , and has a boatload of simulator time , so he 's a natural to fly the mission . he convinces gosset to go along with him , and his two-ship is on the way . the flying scenes are nothing spectacular , with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys , and kfirs ( modified mirages ) acting as migs . cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer ; i 'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft . these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit , flight , and combat models . anyway , lots of explosions on the way in , lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone-go figure . he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land ( ! ) and pick him up . more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground , taxi 's out and takesoff . he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued . rather than the prison sentence for espionage , and theft of government property that lou , the kid , his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should 've got , he gets his slot at the air force academy . the end . overall , i guess lou 's performance was fairly good , but everyone else performed at the grade-b level this flick is . note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid 's buds . worth seeing for laughs , and as a film version of a kid 's pilot fantasy .	2
very easy to install ; great tool for easily downloading photos to computer and removing from camera ; would recommend to anybody	1
this machine bubbles but they are anything but quiet . the water was cold in less than 2 minutes even though i put hot water in has per the instructions . a bucket would probally have done better along with air pump from my fish tank	3
these did not suppress my appetite , though many days i took 3 tablets three times a day ! had very good luck with a bottle of dytrexil ( also a hoodia product ) , but the next bottle of that , nothing . i guess like crops , you can get good batches and bad batches . these struck me as a bad batch . as one reviewer said , i actually felt hungrier many days . egad ! better luck next time ! sigh	3
i really dislike this software . i 'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way . first , when you initially select files and folders , your disk choices are " c : " or " all " . i have several disks and i want to pick and choose , but this program makes that really difficult . then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up . choose carefully , because you wo n't be allowed to change it later ! and if you want to do incremental backups , be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save , because you ca n't do it later . basically the entire job , future backups and all , must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over .	5
i was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source . agree with other users- -this mirror was no better than an unlighted one .	3
oh man , this sucks really bad . good thing nu-metal is dead . thrash metal is real metal , this is for posers	4
i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom . she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time , then automatically shut off . tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail . i had to return it . however , i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great .	3
i really enjoyed this movie and felt it was better than the remake . both this one and the new one hold to a very similar story line	2
very easy to use , multiple languages , something nice and easy for even unexperienced users . recommend to anybody buy it , it 's worth it . and the price is right for the features and mp . i would not hesitate to pay more for this camera . kodak has done wonderful job with this on	1
this is an all around awesome product . i have had great experiences with the program , and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school 's yearbook . anyone one who says it does n't have the basics is pretty much lying to you , it has anything you 'll ever need and more . the people who review this product poorly do so because they do n't know how to use everything in it . the only problem i 've ever had is learing everything you can do with it , otherwise it is perfect	5
microsoft is simply sloppy with their programming ! " open office " is a better program , is open-source ( meaning if you do n't want some paperclip 's help , you simply do n't download that part of it ) and open office is free ! it is also compatible with most of the functions that ms office uses ( and is upgraded with new features faster than ms 's product , which is a rip-off ! ) ms 's office 97 was the best of the office suites , even though it did have it 's problems , spending the money to supposedly " upgrade " to this ( or any other microsoft product for that matter ) is simply burning your money ! ) open-source software is free , it 's perfectly legal , it is open t anyone decompiling it , so if you want to make your own custom goodies , you can , but then there are so many written by so many people willing to share , you do n't have to develop your own , as there are already *so* many freebie ones ( and some low-cost additions by some places , but most are free ) that if you want whistles and bells , or even a christmas theme in february , you can get it for open office ! ( not so with this or any microsoft product for that matter ) simply sloppy programming - nothing more , and you can get a fully functioning and compatable office suite for free legally	5
what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style . he is careful not to over do it , while still demonstrating skill and precision . his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed . the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs , i rarely make it to the end of this cd . still for those who enjoyed & quot ; a go-go&quot ; , this one is quite similar , so make sure to pick it up . this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking , but is a great casual listen . ( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !	4
works fine . like several other office packages lacks database program , access	5

if you have kids or grandkids , who think about politics & like " sf " ; give them this book ! it was one of the many heinlein works that helped me grow up . it is the best & most important of his " for kids novels " . i ment to give it 5 stars ! ! ! !	0
it is now almost a month since i bought the upgrade to xp prof . for my destop computer running w2k prof . i have had nothing but trouble . my notebook computer , connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months , suddenly could not connect to the desktop . all network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing . i called ms and things got worse . now i have an dditional problem ( no sound on my desktop ) and the first problem remains unsolved . i have been through three layers of ms technicians , only the last of which spoke english with an accent close enough to mine to be understood . nonce could fix the problems and they are now " researching " the problem and supposed to call me this morning . during one of the calls , the tech . tried to blame it on my notebook . if any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company , you 'll ercognize the situation . right now , i would prefer getting a refund and returning to w2k	5
i purchased " empty " not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable , but eventually forgettable , pop / rock . this sophomore effort is , simply put , amatuer and sub-par . some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as " empty " b-sides , while the cover of " electric avenue " never really distracts most listeners from thinking " what is this and why ? " over all , this might appeal to most christian radio listeners , but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is : mold-fitting white noise	4

metheny 's an innovator and has been all over the map over his long career in terms of styles , moods , textures , and sounds . here we have an early effort in which he takes his guitar and overdubs an introspective , wide-open-spaces musical journey across america , weaving in jazz , folk , country , rock , mountain music , and everything in between . if you love his work on joni mitchell 's amelia ( performed live on shadows and light ) , you 'll love the sound of this record . the mood is mellow but not dull , quiet but not silent , and the results are spectacular . this is the cd to take with you on a trip across the western frontier , or a short hop to burger king . works either way	4
the chair has simple pre-set programs ( i basically use only the full-body massage ) , but also allows for designing your own massage by choosing specific movements and massage area . of course it is not the same as a real massage and not as good as the $2 , 500 chairs , but offers a great way to relax your back muscles at a great value	3
easy tax preparation and lots of information , videos , and help . i even bought stock in intuit because i also use their quicken product . awsome products.. . no wonder microsoft had their eye on it before	5

my daughter ( 13 ) and i tried the number devil together . she has add and has difficulty with math . we found the intro to be too long and the games boring . this game did not keep her attention at all . we also tried math blaster and would recommend that game instead . i am glad others have found this game helpful unfortunately it didnt for us .	5
this computer system , although almost universally accepted , can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free , such as the fedora project ( a distribution of linux , a os which can be changed by anyone for free ) , or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around ï¿½50 ( $90 ) or less	5
heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention . unfortunately , these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere . this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein 's final books . we are also treated to some of heinlein 's stock characters , dirty old men , horny female computers , naked adolescent girls , and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips . without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed . as if this is n't enough , heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing . in spite of all their cameo appearances , this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout . heinlein 's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people , especially boys . this novel , as well as most of heinlein 's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption	0
i bought this title because the first typing instructor for kids got such good reviews . i was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding . he has always had a terrible time with handwriting . i knew i needed really easy , slow-paced typing instruction for him , or he would n't get it . well , it 's 6 months later and he can now type ! we did it with nothing but this software . i made him practice about 10 min / day 5 - 7 days / week . all in all , he found it to be work to learn this new skill , but still rather enjoyable . there are 11 games included and several of them are very good - - meaning they are really fun and build typing skills at the same time . there is also a series of drills , lessons , and typing tests to teach the keyboard . the keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time , and then you repeat the related drills , lessons , tests , and games until those keys are learned fairly well . i had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section . this is what the software recommends , but i had to learn it the hard way . at first , i let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed . i ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section . i would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11. the cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that . however , for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons , this would be an excellent way to learn to type too . i found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software .	5
i thought this was a great product . it 's like having your own guitar instructor , but even better . you only have to pay once and you get hours of instructions you can use for as long as you want . also , you can use it any time you want without having to make a trip . i 'm pleased with my purchase . you will be too	5
this is the jacksons second album for epic and producers gamble and huff . it would be their last with gamble and huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should . music 's takin over , different kind of lady and do what you wanna are great , catchy dance tracks . the real greatness here lies in the ballads where michael 's voice is in peak form . even though you 're gone and find me a girl are classic ballads . so good , i feel that find me a girl is probably the best michael jackson song you 've never heard . this is probably michael jackson 's most overlooked album and its one of his best ! the jacksons all sing together great and you can see why destiny and triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded . overall , great ballads , catchy feel good dance tracks , and michael jackson singing his heart out . get this , you will not be dissaponted	4
over the past two years i have been using several different green food products to try to find one that has a reasonable taste and seems to satisfy my physical needs . at age 70 those needs are many . after approximately two rounds of trying , it is miracle greens that has been most consistant in good taste and at the same time satisfying many of the needs i have for feeling better in general	3
not his best stuff . he 's running short of lyrical ideas , he recycles his own lines , like star wars recycles " i have a bad feeling about this " . beats are usually cool , i do n't care for the popish tracks with the singing . i did n't mind it so much when he sang really bad back on his first album , but now it 's no longer funny , it sounds like pop . anyhow , organized religion is crap . i thought krs understood this back in the day . what happened ? now he 's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy , and his only little diciples and crap , i dunno , it 's posative , but then again it 's gay like some of his modern tracks . anyhow it is cheap , if you have to finish off your collection as i do , then buy it , otherwise go buy his anything boombap on back . or check out : kool keith el-p gang starr mr. lif jedi miind tricks public enemy non phixion sir menelik most of which is better than krs ' latest works	4
i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend . high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track . i was figuring on getting an arm unit , but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work . the whole system is very easy to use and fast . you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading , but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you . i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy . i can say this was a great gift , something i use a lot , and something that will help me stay healthy	3
this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man . at first , the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters , but the series remain true to the comics . the story lines they took from the comics were done very well , like episodes involving the silver surfer	2
i thought that i could never learn piano on my own . all the material that i ever looked into either did n't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good . because of this software , i am constantly learning new things , and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist . if you are a beginner , you want to buy this software . it 's done wonders for me	5
i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up / down- --this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker- -really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one	1
they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was . the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden , the paid wwe guys just began to bad-mouth the warrior . maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young , and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other . they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations . vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test . as soon as he says this , they fade to black then come back with a new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they 're talking about steroids . but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use . let 's not talk about that - let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior . and they also just try to badmouth him so much . who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him ? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including hulk . and oh yeah - they do n't even let the warrior defend himself . why did i have to find out from imdb.com that he was asked to appear but declined ? why do n't they address this ? this " docu " is more slanted than " fahrenheitt 911 " every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth , tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking .	2
just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like " they rock " or " the lead singer is soooo hot " are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music	4

ok , i just could not resist coming on here to review this . i 've had this cd for about 4 years now and i still listen to quite a bit , proof right there that this cd is definetly a classic ( in my book at least ) every single song on here is original , the guitar riffs are simply amazing , and the lyrics i can not even describe in words how much they hit home and how breathtaking they are . if your a goo goo doll fan , and you still do not have this cd , i deeply encourge you to go buy it now ! this is the is the goos like you 've never heard them before . the cd is pure genius , and in my opinion the best cd i 've ever heard	4
when i bought this i played it on repeat for about 45 hours . different versions than on the album ( i think it 's their demo ) . this version of modern age is amazing . definitely worth buying	4
the documentation is terrible . its going to take a lot of practice . if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine . however i want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x sb600s . just setting the d200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the sb800 / masster & sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail , in the manual . the sb800 is designed for this purpose . so why not include information on how to do this ?	1
you know i thought this would be a great cd but no it is a total piece of dreck except for ken nordine he is a god in spoken word , i wished i would have bought two coppies one to poop on and one to cover it up .	4
this was actually the first kellerman novel i read and i found it kind of dull at first , but that 's only because i did n't know any of the situations or people among whom i was thrust . after reading a couple earlier books , i have re-read this one and i now find it interesting . so , i would really have to recommend that one tries to read the series more or less in order . this one starts out with alex delaware seeing a new girlfriend named allison . robin has married another man after some ten ( ? ) years with alex . [i have n't read the one where she actually leaves yet ( unless this is the first mention of it ) , but if she broke his heart ... ! ] see , i had no idea who robin was first time i read this - makes a difference . the cuuuuute little dog named spike makes an appearance too . first time i read it , he was just an irritating little squirt , but now i know just how adorable he can really be and it was nice seeing him again . alex 's police pal milo is a lieutenant now and can pick and choose his cases . he and alex are together when they come across a grisly crime scene . a young couple has been brutally murdered and the woman can not even be identified . milo draws alex into the investigation and it gets complicated . everything seems to lead back to the dead boy 's psychologist and when she turns up murdered too , things really start cooking with gas ! i adore detective milo sturgis . i know alex is the star , but i ca n't help it . milo is such a great character	0
boney used to be the man , but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him . anyone who thinks this cd is good should listen to his older stuff like seduction , trust , or backbone . you will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential . cmon'boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of . peace	4
there 's nothing like grabbing a warm totally sanitized toothbrush . i have used this for years after i saw the inventor on 20 / 20 i had to try it out . it works great ! its like using a new toothbrush everyday . well worth it	3
i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon s410 on a scuba diving trip . i was a little nervous at first ( i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone ! ) , but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably ! i used it on 6 dives , and all of them were to depths of 80+ feet . i did not have one leak ! a word of caution- -i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel ( just a small amount ) . i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this , but i did not want to take any chances . i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach	1
it vibrates like a massage mode of sonic complete . you 'll get less than what you pay . you should brush hard even while it is vibrating	3
if you buy this be sure to set a restore point before installing . this may work if you have never installed any other anti-virus software . this is not for a novice computer user to install unless maybe you are installing on a brand new computer . after uninstalling norton ( my previous anti virus software ) i installed kapersky and immediately had total system lockup with warning message from windows ( the old blue screen of death ) saying a serious problem had occurred and if i had recently installed new hardware or software to uninstall it . which i did , then logged onto the kapersky forum and was told to download a norton removal tool and run it and then reinstall . i did this and still ended up with total lockup and warning message . after three tries i gave up . luckily i had set restore points and was able to get my system back and am now back to using norton . according to the forum there are also problems if you have installed mcafee . i am running windows xp . since i never got to use it i ca n't judge whether it has any value .	5

alright , for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals , or lacking in substance , i say this : who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are ? who is rand to say what substance is ? you 've got to look at her bias , first . realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom . as if outside factors never matter ; and maybe they do n't , for her . maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today . but i doubt it . though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live , outside influences do affect a person . but she doesn't . thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap . all books that are not driven solely by the individual 's sense of reason : do n't read , cause it will lessen your iq . any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does n't find worthwhile or cannot understand , she condemns . rand , at least as portrayed in what i 've read of her work , is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants . and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes . they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality , they are either good or worthless . the pieces of art she says are empty are empty , absolutely . they do n't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer . nothing to offer her , that is . how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history 's best books , telling other people ( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual ) what they should read ? truthfully any criticism in this form , like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world , is elitist crap trying to close people 's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others . they have their bias like anyone else . i say read in variety . observe art outside of rand 's choice of art . take in all you can , with an open mind , then start pondering whether you agree or not . if you then agree because you agree , then i say great . its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address . she says question society , but by my line of inquiry . she says be an individual , but only i know the basis of who you want to be	0
first off that has to be the worst rhyme i 've ever heard in my life.. . andre nickatina ( in the rapping world ) is one of the worst i 've ever heard , but if you 're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them ( reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves , paddling every which way to stay with them ) , and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says ( what feels like ) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night . but overall , " if you ca n't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ai n't able " summs this and the rest of the nickatina c.d.s up	4
this is an outstanding documentary of the campaign team that changed presidential campaigning . one does not need to love the results of these changes ( i personally believe that this campaign was the beginning of the end of democracy as we know it , even as i marveled at the talent and loved the outcome of the election ) to appreciate how clinton 's 1992 campaign , as seen in this film , changed the american political world . " war room " should be seen along with more recent documentaries ( like , for example , " staffers ' 04 " ) to see the difference between a campaign that used techniques to achieve a goal and campaigns that use the same techniques as the goal ( to be elected rather than to govern ) . hopefully , it will encourage you to do what you can to return political campaigns to discussions of ideas rather than the useless , mind-numbing , dumbing down assessments of candidate traits ( like " character " or " integrity " ) we seem to have resorted to in the past ten years	2
this program has a bug in processing 1099-r data that makes the whole software package useless to me . after filling in the data from my 2005 1099-r form , the program informed me that these monies were taxable in 2003 not 2005 , and that these data would not be included in my 2005 return . i could not find a way overide this problem . also , there was no apparent way to directly contact h&r block to find out how to fix it . after wasting a couple of hours i now have to trash the taxcut software and spend more money to purchase turbo-tax , which from prior years experience is relatively bug free .	5
i was n't sure if it would be worth spending the money on this case . how wrong i was . if you 're into diving and have one of these cameras , buy it now	1
this is an honestly forgivably slightly too long film that manages to be surprisingly crass with three dimensional characters and capture much of war 's bad brutality ( but necessity hey the men and women set fire to are all deranged nazis ) . i love the scenes best where sutherland plays a general and the part where the english chicks show up at sort of dance with the dozen ( interesting if english jill ireland had been one of the ladies there- -with charles bronson looking at her- - which she wasn't -- -but the mostly hot chicks they have do just fine ) . before i saw the film i heard ernest borgnine was in the movie and i thought he was going to be one of the dozen . there is no really solidly likable member of the dozen ( sutherland 's probably the closest they come to this and he is rather undeveloped ) and borgnine could have fit the bill very nicely had he been a convict- -instead they 've got him in a more dull role of a general . but what the dozen lack in likability they make up for in interest . cassavettes ( whom i strongly physically resemble by the way ) is outstanding as the most crooked but slickest member of the dozen and he shines best . savalas is next best as the lust hating psycho ( hey sex between men and women is needed to produce babies , telly , or the human race would have ceased to exist a long time ago and the book of genesis talks of man and woman becoming one ) . bronson is the true chameleon of an actor as just 8 years later he 'd be the very different vigilante paul kersey of death wish so different than the very tough but still gentler fellow he plays here . marvin brilliant in the lead as the head major leading the dozen ( probably even better than the very good john wayne would have been ) . nice turn by bob ryan as a decent colonel who rather understandably makes things hard for the covert dozen . the rest of the cast is mostly very good too . very good film !	2
metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever . most of their trite albums deserve no stars . their only good cds are either master of puppets , or black album . kill em all is such a bore ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! james hetfield , the lead singer just screams and ca n't sing at all ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! why ? ? ? ? why ca n't he sing more proper like lou greamm ( foreigner ) , & mark knopfler ( dire straits ) ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? each and every song on this album is bad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! do n't listen to the people who rate metallica 's albums a five star . they are overrated....green day is better . get them , dire straits , and foreigner insted . ps. this album is worth a minus trillion .	4
this item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly . also it does not work well at all . if you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least . many times it stays flat and when it does " rise " it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs . i would have returned the item , but i left it for my mother when i had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time i returned my 30 day window was closed . do not buy , you will regret it if you do . i wo n't even put this item in a yard sale , because i would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it .	3
great compact design . takes up very little room in your suitcase . rollers heat up & are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims . sets hair better then most rollers ( and i have tried many ) . the only thing that i would change , is to add 2-4 more rollers . but i liked these rollers so much , i actually bought a 2nd set & use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !	3
who could like a band like the rolling stones ? they are not the world 's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but start me up and shattered . their new album is the most horrible cd i have ever heard . stay far away from that cd . get anything from the stones that contains start me up or shattered insted .	4
these clic glasses are a great idea.. . i first saw them on csi-ny , and sought them out , but they are not made big enough.. . they worked fine as long as i was looking down , but as soon as i turned my head level , or looking up , the glasses would " pop " apart . i had purchased two pair , and returned them both	3

fifty-five minutes into this film , after freya ( jane march ) listens to the beast 's explanation of his current condition- -it is the punishment of odin for killing a bear- -she says , " what does it mean ? it makes no sense . " although there is still half an hour yet to come , these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of " beauty and the beast . " the very title blood of beasts ( plural ) makes no sense . the film shows us only one beast- -a kind of man-bear- -and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of odin 's pet bear , blended or fused with the man who killed it . academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly sven ( played by william gregory lee ) is a kind of beast as well ( thus giving us two beasts ) , but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended . most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film . surely the blurb on the back of the dvd 's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either ; e.g. , it is untrue that freya " must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people . " nor is it true that " the beast [singular] . . . battles with freya for his redemption . " further , expect no truth in these grand-sounding words : " prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice , damnation and salvation . " btw , the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of jane march / freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner : the arrow 's shaft is two or three inches above her hand that 's gripping the bow . with one exception , the acting is a perfect match for the script : laughably poor . the exception is the beast ( played by david dukas ) . one is tempted to quip that only this role has " teeth " ; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers ( or whoever ) to enhance the actor 's voice electronically , only his role required serious make-up , and only his role required a " special effect " ( his morphing back to agnar , which every semi-conscious viewer , by a third of the way into the film , knew was coming ) . other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this viking saga and the laughable " ships . " most preposterous is the tiny skiff that freya and ingrid ( candice hillebrand ) use to rescue king thorsson ( greg melvill-smith ) . on the island , the beast possesses an iron cage ( which clearly has been welded together using 20th - or 21st-century equipment ) ; when the king is confined in it , it can only be secured from the outside- -and yet , when freya is put inside it for her own protection at night , only she has control of its locking device . how convenient . the costumes are also anacronistically interesting , but only ms. march 's deserve extended comment . when we first see her , she is wearing a little black viking bikini as she swims with friends ; then , besides flimsy chain mail , we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics- -the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top . lest this review seem too harsh , a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions : mark thomas , who composed the viking music ; rob bishop , one of the focus pullers ; ryan lotter and steven ndlovu , two clapper loaders ; andrew gribble , a grip ; ben phiri , the generator operator ; guy bonner , transport manager ; johannes sithole , fabrication assistant ; kirsty taylor , prosthetics ; maxmillian van der merwe , standby set dresser ; dirk knoesen , stand-by [sic] carpenter ; sally van der merwe , scenic artists [sic] ; janine wyatt-mair , stunt performer ; grace sibiyo , seamstress ; diane allen , hair supervisor ; bianca , trainee make-up assistant ; ian thysse , medic ; and mark ferda , who did double duty as both dialogue editor and re-recording mixer . oh , one more thing : after coming out of her cage in the morning , jane march seems to have a nude swim in the sea , which the poor beast views from hiding , far-far-far away	2
i purchased this item for $10 from comp usa . there was a problem with some of the files so when i finished installing it , my computer was a mess . i lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else . it took me a while to get the program removed and i eventually ended up doing a system restore . when the screensaver came up it did look awesome . i wish i could have used it but i am not going to try and install it again .	5

first of all i do not consider myself anything more than a very beginning photographer ! ! ! so i will not go into anything technical . i will leave that to people who know more than i do . but what i am is an international traveler . i simply got tired of coming home from fantastic trips with " snapshots " . i wanted someting much better , and boy did i get it with this camera . i looked at the d70s and since i have very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera is smaller without being small . i have only taken photos locally , but at this time of the year with the leaves changing it makes a good start . the built in editing features ( filters etc. ) are wonderful to work with . i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who wants something more than " point and shoot " snap shots	1
i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena . however , i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created : there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition . the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me . i disagree with the simplistic conclusion ( among others ) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china	0
this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods / godesses associated with the winter soltice . the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible . save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme .	0

i am not a horror movie fan , in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me , but this one indeed made me literally crap myself . i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc 2 years ago , and luckily the movie was just starting , so i got to see it from beginning to end . this movie is basically about a man named frank zito ( joe spinell ) who 's a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women , because he feels he 's getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute . after her death frank feels alone , but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years . frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city , in which he keeps several mannequins . he uses these mannequins by putting his victim 's bloody scalps , on it 's heads . when he spots a woman named anna ( caroline munro ) , a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her , but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her , but kind of a romantic interest . he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts , but will he change his mind about her , and make her become another one of his victims ? some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut-wrenching , especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station , and she hides in a bathroom stall . i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time . the effects were realistic ( nice job tom savini ! ) , they do n't come close to todays , even though the movie was released in 1980. joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real , and not only that , but he physically looked the part too . the scenes where he 's in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie . i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there , because we get to see the results of how an alone , mistreated child might turn out . this is n't one of those lame zombie movies , it 's the real deal . if you like horror , and a lot of gore , and you have n't seen this then i recommend you watching this .	2
well , at least the movie is faithful to its source in its spirit . based on a book written on 1902 , it 's nostalgia of the british empire belongs to that era . the plot deals with a soldier who is expelled from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so	2

as mentioned , this book is amazingly compact , cramming three semesters of calculus and a bit of ordinary differential equations into just 800 pages . that conciseness also implies that much explanatory material and many illustrative examples are missing . the authors mention in the preface that " classifiers of calculus books would call this a traditional book . most theorems are proved or left as exercises to prove.. . " nearly every result in this book has an accompanying proof . for those with a serious interest in mathematics , this is a useful resource . for most others , the presence of so many proofs can be overwhelming and probably is a turnoff . included with the book is a one-page detachable reference card containing a massive amount of valuable information , including common rules for derivatives and integrals , geometric formulas , a few conversion factors , trigonometric identities and graphs ( very useful ! ) , and more . the book also has a three-page comprehensive table of integrals in the inside back cover and a listing of geometric formulas in the front , along with a commemorative timeline and portraits featuring the deceased european males who made calculus possible . given all of this , i would highly recommend this book as an 800-page calculus reference text , or maybe as a text in an honors calculus sequence that expects to use the text throughout multiple semesters - then using it saves you money . but for those who do n't have a super-strong background or interest in math , those who are just taking calculus for a requirement or those who have never seen calculus before , or for those who are just plain math-phobic - using this book just does n't make any sense . i would n't recommend it . for those who are stuck with this book for a course , i 'd suggest looking for another book to help you out . one possible book has already been mentioned in another review : silvanus thompson and martin gardner 's " calculus made easy " , a book that dates back originally to 1910 ( ! ) . i 've read parts of it , and the book looks good to me . i 'm sure that there are many other helpful books ; try checking your local / university library or looking on amazon for ideas . an extra calculus textbook that 's more student-friendly might be a good idea . as for the pages falling out , i have n't had a problem with it ( i have the 8th edition ) , but i do n't use the book all that much . i have n't found any serious errors in the text , but i have n't read everything thoroughly , having only used the text for calc iii . and , yeah , getting the student solutions manual would probably be a good idea	0
it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them , and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds . here we have yet another double-helping of their ageless wisdom , strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment . though not as crass and offensive as stolt 's " wall street voodoo " or bodin 's " i am " , this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness . there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release , but not enough to justify its purchase . stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that " ...peace & love never go out of fashion.. . " well , neither does informed maturity , and you wo n't find any of that in this group 's recent output . just more utopian preaching and good vs. evil typecasting . their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international , but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st. jude 's children 's hospital . i 'm going to sell my copy of " paradox hotel " , and probably several more flower kings cds , to do just that . there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would-be hippies	4

several years ago i used delorme 's street atlas with a usb gps receiver . the software worked but the interface was lousy . this year i tried microsoft 's streets and trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software , but still surprisingly clumsy . and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product ( that 's saying a lot ) . here are some of the problems : 1. street & trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a **com port**. are you kidding me ? in 2007 ? ? ? the delorme earthmate 20 ( usb ) will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software , but why is this necessary ? ? ? ( and it was not trivial to get it to work . ) 2. the handling of pushpins ( identifying spots on the map ) , favorite places , and the like , is extremely clumsy . ( although , contrary to another review , you do n't to re-enter the information each time . you just save the file and reload it . ) 3. directions are sometimes not so great . why would you instruct someone to " turn left " if you do n't know which direction they 're pointing ( e.g. , when you 're stationary in a parking lot ) ? much better in such cases to say " head ne " or some such . freeway exits ( at least in so . california ) were often not handled well . ( one freeway entrance was identified as a " local road " , which at the time proved quite confusing . ) 4. why does n't the software automatically recalculate directions to put you " on-route " once you 're off-route ? you can push f3 , but why is this necessary ? 5. i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work . the online help was useless . i 'm sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it , but it should be trivial . 6. in general , the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together . i 'm not a reflexive anti-microsoft bigot ( i bought this software after all ) , but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it 's cobbled together without much attention given to integration . it 's shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it . given this experience , i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around .	5
about the band : dead can dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre . in fact , the name of the label , 4ad , which carried many of the 1990s dcd releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments . brendan perry sometimes has been described as a gothic frank sinatra . lisa gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to lisa . i count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . about the album : compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of into the labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't for the fact that i like to listen to this album over and over again . i count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized dead can dance cd . one of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both lisa 's and brendan 's ghostly vocals . on some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals . simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to . i honestly give this album my highest recommendations ! two tracks i 'd recommend sampling : " towards the within " ( featuring lisa 's vox w / brendan backing ) and " tell me about the forest " ( featuring brendan 's vox ) . i believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album . please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in english are included in the liner notes . similar artists : chances are if you are n't yet familiar with dead can dance , that you 've not yet discovered some of these other bands , but i highly recommend them as well : das zeichen , impressions of winter , love is colder than death , qntal , corvus corax , or helium vola . there is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to dead can dance . please check some of them out as well .	4

when i bought a digital camera , i already knew that i would need rechargeable batteries for it . what i did n't realize was how quickly the camera would eat the supplied alkalines . i had taken barely a dozen pictures before they were drained to the point where the camera would no longer operate ! so i looked for a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger and quickly settled on this one because of previous experience with monster cable 's products . it performs better than advertised . the initial charge may have taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges have been much quicker . i have yet to drain these batteries to the point where they wo n't operate the camera . the charger itself is an attractive unit for an appliance , and has an led indicator that lights up red for charging and changes to green to indicate fully charged . it is compact enough to fit comfortably in the camera bag and the plug folds into the back of it . i have had good service from it and can highly recommend this charger	1
argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by lumiere . after hitchcock and ray , leone and fuller , argento is the last true auteur to make genre films . visually , a film like profondo rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed , objects and people alike , take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film . argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker . cinema is not an answer but a question and argento is the answer to eisenstein 's theory of film as violence , violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them . a murder , a painting , a mother , a son , a mirror , all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing , the mystery of cinema , the questions , are resolved .	2

the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason : the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . for instances , his endless digressions about history , politics , and philosophy . for the movie , we are left with nothing but plot and character . ok , what is one to do ? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought : i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie . this is a slow film . it takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it . i ca n't recommend the film	2
i have never been a fan of danielle steel 's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime , and those many years ago . i 'm not sure what motivated me to pick up toxic bachelors - - extreme boredom ? insanity ? - - but i slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer 's work . actually , i think i was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was . the writing was completely repetitive and superficial , and i rather felt that i was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself . it read like a poor book report : " ...and then he did this , and then he did this , and after that he did this , and then he laughed . " we are told that the bachelors - - who struck me as commitment-phobic , a little neurotic , and fairly immature despite their ( middle ) age , but not necessarily toxic - - are decent , likable guys , but we never really see too much proof of that . when the " proof " does come , it 's so ham-handed as to be laughable : charlie 's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother , and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character . yeahsurerightwhatever . most of the story is told through narration , with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue . the author adopted a third-person point of view , but there 's certainly nothing omniscient about it , and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters . throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls , and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable . this is how men behave and relate to one another ? i find that hard to believe , considering that none of the men i know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other . i liked the female characters of the book initially . they all seemed to be strong , capable , independent and emotionally healthy women . but my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book , as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man . and the conflicts steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous : mountains out of molehills . for instance , gray , the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family , refuses to meet the adult children of the woman he 's been with for several months and whom he claims to love . nevermind the fact that he 's known about the adult children since the very beginning . nevermind the fact that the adult children live in england and italy , while gray and sylvia are new yorkers . nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent , self-sufficient adults who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits . evidently gray ca n't see beyond the fact that they are " kids " and therefore " family " and therefore not to be tolerated . sorry , but whatever sympathy i 'd developed for gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity . dump the weenie , sylvia . you can do better . the other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness , and of course everything was wrapped up magically , with sudden capitulation , as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses . considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters , their conflicts and resolution , i have to wonder why steel even bothered writing this book . and why i bothered reading i	0
" rip it off " is not an easy film to watch . in short , it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line , leaving only the most attentive viewer ( read : myself ) to guess at what was going to happen next . but not in a good way . judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes , not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd , it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as alyson hannigan and jennifer esposito . it begs the question : why did you do this film ? or , on a personal note , why did i buy this film , especially at $22 and change ? frankly , i bought it because of alyson hannigan : she 's gorgeous , obviously intelligent , and the girl can act . individually speaking , she does not disappoint here . it 's obvious that she really did n't want to sleep walk through her role as lexi , and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with . although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes , she is a singularly interesting actor to watch , and her performance simply wants me to see her do more , preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film ( see jennifer aniston in her brave performance in " the good girl . " ) but enough gushing : if ms. hannigan had not been as engaged , i would have trashed her soundly . most everyone else in " rip it off " ( with the possible exception of the fellow who plays sergei with operatic relish ) is more or less " phoning it in " when they do their scenes . this made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy . also , films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort : beware ! do not adjust your screen ; the appearance of the film is inherently bad . " rip it off " and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye . i 've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey . and , contrary to the technical description of the dvd , it is presented in the horror that is full screen , and not widescreen . can you believe people invest money in these films ? ( ahem .	2
released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia , presumably to meet high demand for ac / dc 's music , this international version of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " is a farce . once again , somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence , and replacing both " r.i.p. ( rock in peace ) " and " jailbreak " , two of the strongest numbers in the album 's aussie version , with t.n.t. 's " rocker " and " love at first feel " , an ok , if not spectacular song . ah , and " problem child " , already featured in atlantic 's version of " let there be rock " , is also included in here . the same song in two different " official albums " . marvelous ! . oh yeah , and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re-design the front and back covers . that was a cute detail , but the aussie version 's covers ( classic mid 70 's cartoonish artwork ) are far more appealing . who 's to blame for this rip off ? . somebody at atlantic records ? . some members of ac / dc ? . maybe both ? . who cares anyway ? . once again , now that i 've got used to the aussie album , listening back to this " product " feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated , low quality spirits . every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took , and still take risks , by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will . so , it seems that , with their approval of this re-issue , the surviving members of ac / dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on , and on , and on ... if this is so ... well ... guys , we , the fans made you filthy rich . we deserve the " real deal " , available worldwide , at a " reasonable price " . i only give this " product " a 2 star rating , just because " love at first feel " remains unreleased in australia . how unusual ! . a final word about this re-issue : i do n't own it . in the words of pete townshend , i " wo n't get fooled again " . in order to get bonus material , you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick . if bon scott ( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever ) , was still alive , i believe things would be different . by the way , if you are interested in the real stuff , please be so kind as to read my review of " dirty deeds done dirt cheap " ( import ) . other items to be avoided : the skimpy " retrospective " ep " ' 74 jaibreak " , and " bonfire " , a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice , in different versions . none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac / dc 's first four aussie albums	4
i was eager to see this movie , having loved the original " american werewolf " movie ; but was sadly disappointed . i did n't care at all for the characters , the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen . mark me off if you do n't agree - i know you rude lot will anyway - but that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it	2
i 've been using the omron hbf-306 body fat analyzer for a month or so now . so far i 've been very impressed with its consistency . however , i would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the omron 's measurements to see how accurate it is . it 's well built and very easy to use . once you set up your profile , it only takes a few seconds to get a read . i would give it 5 stars but again i dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with . still a good product at a good price .	3
before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop . my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too . the colors were spot on . after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse . my monitor appears dim , the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull . if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time . my hope was that it would make my monitor look better , not worse . i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it . instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	5
it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer . yeah , maybe my fish can get a record deal : they " sing " in tone , can breath , but refue to lip-synch ( i know it sounds gay ) . this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments , write their own songs , and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention . let 's take the band king 's x : doug pinnick ( vocals / bass ) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god ( king 's x is a christian band ) ; ty tabor ( guitar / vocals ) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know ; and jerry gaskill ( drums / vocals ) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people ( i know a lot more people than that like kx ; i 'm just exagerating ) seem to like this band . it 's sad . if you want good music , listen to the band i just menioned ( king 's x if you were n't paying attention ) . ( if amazon does n't post this i will seriously get poed !	4
when my virus protection was about to expire , i was in a quandary . i was n't at all happy with the norton i had purchased last year . and , i was n't especially pleased with the mcafee i had used the year before that . when i checked the local stores , there did n't seem to be anything else to choose from . i checked amazon and found more options , plus plenty of customer comments to help me decide . my son told me that bitdefender had been given the highest rating by consumer reports . that , together with other customer comments on amazon , helped me decide to give it a try . so far , i 'm delighted with its performance . in fact , when i first installed it , it found a virus and some suspicious cookies that norton never caught . it does n't appear to be interferring with my system operations ( unlike norton and mcafee ) , it and does n't constantly interrupt with pop-ups and unnecessary warnings . the best thing is that it gives me two years of protection for the price of one year with the other guys	5

this camcorder is terrible in just about every way : cons : - unacceptably blurry video ; the specs say it records at 640x480 , but it looks more like 320x240 ( if that ! ) blown up to vga . - noticeable aura around any dark shape on a lighter background . - awful light sensitivity ; forget about recording indoors- -no matter how brightly the room is lit , faces will come out too dark . the built-in led 's do n't help much ( and not at all at distances over 4 feet from the subject ) . - noisy zoom that gets picked up loud and clear by the microphone . - zooming goes in irregular steps- -completely useless while recording . - video lags noticeably behind camera movement ; when image stabilization is turned on , the lag becomes so atrocious that you ca n't tell when to stop panning- -utterly useless ! - when using av-in and av-out cables , the firmware has frozen on me a couple of times ; the only way to reset the camera was to remove the battery . - video encoding ( through the av-in cable ) produces an unacceptably noisy and undersaturated result . - the lcd display has a very narrow viewing angle ; anything more than about 10% and you ca n't make out a thing . - still photos taken at the native 5mp resolution come out strangely grainy and uneven- -something like a " sharpen " effect gone wrong . i can get better looking pictures with my 2mp canon powershot a40 camera . - the manual recommends keeping the camera motionless for 2-3 seconds after snapping a picture ( that 's on top of the 3-4 seconds it takes the thing to focus before it snaps ) ; but you ca n't keep the subject from moving , folks ! welcome to the psychedelic land of image trails.. . - flash photos come out with wildly different color balance depending on the color of the background . - the manual is a sorry affair- -only 17 pages long and does n't go much beyond identifying external controls and menu options . - i could go on and on , but i 'll stop now , as you probably get the picture.. . pros : - the camera body seems sturdily built ; the controls also have a sturdy feel to them , as do the battery and the usb port covers . hmm.. . it 's the only nice thing i can think to say about it . maybe a child ( think pre-teen ) could find this " camcorder " exciting as a toy , but i do n't see how it can be enough even for an undemanding person looking to capture occasional life 's moments on video	1
i 'm not usually a ballet person . i have n't seen anything since " the nutcracker " when i was six . but this was absolutely brilliant . the concept for it is completely bold and original and adam cooper as the swan blew me away . how can you beat a dancer in black leather pants with a riding crop ? tchaikovsky never would have envisioned this , but he would be utterly thrilled to see what they have done with his epic ballet .	2
anyone who had access to a radio in the 80 's would know at least two songs by missing persons . their fun music and amazing flare ( dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great ! ) make this a good party album . i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great . just as an added note , warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran ( my personal favorite band ) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986 ! !	4
this is a great book . i could n't wait to see what was going to happen next and how all the mixups would be straightened out ! it is a very funny and delightful book , i hope there will be a sequel , we need to know what happens to these people , i feel like i know them	0
i bought this for my husband for valentine 's day , so he could have photos of our new baby boy handy . unfortunately , the images appeared for one day , and then the unit stopped working . we had to send the unit back . i was very disappointed as there were many good ratings on the item .	1
this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak . it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak . now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it . very bad investment	3
it is light ; has 6x magnification ; and easy to use . this little tool is great for any golfer . you must know the yardage before you can select the correct club . how far is it to either the top of that bunker next to the green or the flagstick ? next , you just then need to pull the club that will get you there . fits on your belt through a loop in the safe carrying case or use the supplied clip to attached the case to your golf bag . these new laser rangefinders are better than ever and at a lower price than previous models . love it	1
i have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band . all of their records , in general , sound exactly the same , and this one is no exception . post-velvets guitar / organ drones , lackadaisical vocals , blankly uninteresting non-lyrics ( they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting ) , and a dramatic lack of energy ; all of yo la tengo 's trademarks are fully represented here , and if you can stay awake through it , you 're a better man / woman than i . a surpassingly boring record , even from this usually very boring band . if you 've heard the velvet underground , neu ! , stereolab 's early records , and sonic youth , you 've heard yo la tengo in total . if you 're a big enough fan of those named bands , you could probably write songs that sound like & quot ; painful . &quot ; but you would probably write better ones . avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia	4
i have used this book for more than 5 years and take it with me on every trip to paris . if you ca n't get success from these recipes then you might consider some other past time than baking . get used to baking with weights and this book is perfect . something as simple as a madeleinne is created perfectly in weight measures but just a shot in the dark when using volume measurments . this book is not exactly for beginner bakers but if you have some experience it is fantasti	0
i would reccomend this film to any robert johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at . it includes some great interviews with johnny shines , robert jr lockwood and others who knew robert . its worth it just to hear lockwood play an unrecorded song of r.j. 's ! the parts where keb ' mo ' re-enacts segments from r.j. 's life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman . my only criticism would be that there are few extra dvd features , however , that does n't stop me watching this film again and again ! a very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest delta bluesmen	2
i 've had this product for almost a year now . i have very thick , frizzy , hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months , and blowing drying it straight . i 've never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair . but with this one , i have not needed a blow dryer since i got it ! now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life , which i thought i would never see . of course this makes it very straight so i ca n't get any shape or curls from it ( which is what i was going for ) . cut my drying time by almost 2 hours ( as long as i apply some protective serum on when still wet ) . great product and still going strong .	3
i excitedly upgraded to office 2007.... '07 outlook is far slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots ( 110% of resources ) for minutes at a time inexplicably ; spell ck does n't work consistently ; html emails have lost functionality i used to use often with 2003 ver ; excel opens much more slowly ; no real gains in excel fuctionality ; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in excel 2007 ; access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - false ; word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with outlook if you keep both word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine ; the highly touted " ribbon " is mainly cosmetic ; i believe 2007 's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....net , net , i am uninstalling office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it 's too bad no one at msft actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are .	5
i was all set to do the typical 10 day antibiotic course for a sinus infection ( i even had bought the antibiotics ) , but decided to try this first . it is very effective in clearing the sinuses , nose , throat and lungs . couple things : 1. it makes a minor mention of using a solution ( if desired ) in the tank provided . i used vicks . it more than doubles the steam output . so even if you do n't get a solution , use plain water . without it , the output is not impressive . 2. if you do get vicks , get your magnifying glass out and read the dilution instructions . they do not make it clear without reading the fine print that it is a highly concentrated solution . if you add it undiluted , i think you 'll go blind.. . i highly recommend this unit	3
a generation before there was a left behind , there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c . c . carlson . this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america . a phemomenal best seller , it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry . for many christians , their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future . a generation later , many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture , sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events , and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated . so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism ? well , while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events , it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other " prophecy pundits . " while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism , it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book . part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form . for lahaye and jerry b . jenkins , it was the pulp novel . back in 1970 , lindsay and c . c . carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose . like most books of this type ( e.g. , the bermuda triangle , chariots of the gods ? , the philadelphia experiment , the population bomb ) , it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts . like most of these books , it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams . like most of these books , it is laughable in retrospect . if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes , i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp . the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong . after all , it was the 1970 's when wild conspiracy theories , distrust of any traditional authority , and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage . when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age , a ufo invasion , a famine around the corner , and california falling into the pacific ocean , the authors ' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy . however , in the intervening years , the revisions of this book just kept piling up . make a bad prediction ? no problem , edit the book with the old gaffes removed , add a few trendier predictions , and release it as a new book . lindsey , now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years , still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis ( carleton 's contribution is more stylistic ) despite his failed scenarios . lindsey 's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s ( he even wrote a book the 1980's : countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief ) . well that did n't pan out , so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon ( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d. : will mankind survive ? ) . oops , wrong again . first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam ( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred : the roots of jihad ) . when one bogeyman falls , he is quick to insert a new one in its place . between the failed predictions , the hilarious misreadings of the original languages , the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology , and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies " right before our eyes " , it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things . this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels . if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 , it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time . just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism , fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night . however , for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy , it is best to pass . for all its success as a cultural marker , its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil . for this , its original purpose , the late great planet earth is completely worthless .	0
there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments . i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments . i am glad i did . the light from the mirror is bright , the slide bar for the different light settings works very well . if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time . i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use . the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out .	3
i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here . i 'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo : -i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly , they would get stuck about 2-3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand / retract them . very interestingly , if the section right above the one i 'm trying to expand / retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! -the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) a less than 2 lbs combo , which is much lighter than the 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs . the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly . again , it might have been a defective unit , but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted to buy this from amazon , it was n't in stock , it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to $40+ , so i went elsewhere and got it for $30.	1

i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt . i used it on a vacation mainly , and am pretty dissapointed . i 'm no pro , or even skilled amateur , but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots . the autofocusing is slow , and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom . there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me . i wanted a good , all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types . i guess this would fit the bill , if it took sharp pictures . i would n't pay more than $150 for this lens again	1
whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people . but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few of them seem to have jobs ) and party all day . the main character ( sid ) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ( ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism ) . the film appeals to naive youth	2
if you 've been living under a rock for the past year or so , perhaps you can be excused for not having heard about microsoft 's new edition to the windows canon . for all others , vista has become a fact of life , whether or not you actually run the operating system yet . check out a tech website and you 'll find a vista screen shot somewhere , either depicting some impressive overclocking results via cpu-z , or else simply for no other purpose than to show the world , " yes , i can run aero- -are n't you jealous ? " in fact , it 's hard to avoid vista these days . and , as always seems to be the case , most of what you hear is probably negative . that 's where i come in . i 've waited a while before writing this review , both to test the operating system and to wait for the horror stories to fade away . they haven't . and this can only mean one thing : the positive stories are n't getting through because most people who are satisfied with a product generally do n't feel the need to comment on it . now of course you 've probably seen quite a few anxious posts ( most likely in all capital letters ) either bashing microsoft for everything under the sun , praising vista indiscriminately , making it seem as though you need a $5000.00 enthusiast-class computer to run the thing , or boasting about mac 's venerable os x and how windows vista is nothing more than a bad copy thereof . needless to say , none of these sorts of things helps , and all of them create a sense of confusion and negativity that reflects heavily on the product . and , if you analyze them closely , you 'll realize that *none of them actually says anything about windows vista.* if you do n't believe me , then just go visit apple 's discussion area and check out the ipod pages . you 'd get the impression that ipods were the worst products ever made and that every single one has problems . yet , if this were the case , then why have in excess of 100 million units been sold thus far ? the answer is obvious : people seem compelled to review products only if something went wrong with their experience . in short , people confuse review sites with complaint forums . therefore , as the self-proclaimed dr. prog , i feel it my duty to step out of my usual mode of reviewing progressive rock albums and give an honest , no nonsense review of microsoft windows vista home premium . -the interface - ah , yes . you 've heard all about the new windows vista aero interface by now . and virtually every screen shot you 'll ever see will feature aero . but it 's much more than just pretty , glass-like window frames . aero includes many new enhancements to the ui , such as the live thumbnails that appear when you mouse-over minimized windows . as the name suggests , these actually update in real time , so if there is a video or an animation playing in the window , it will appear in the live thumbnail . this is very useful . perhaps less useful but scoring about an 8 on the 1-10 " coolness factor " scale is the oft-mentioned 3d-flip , which allows the user to view a three-dimensional representation of all open windows , along with offering the ability to virtually paw through these to bring the desired window to the forefront . these are the things you 'll hear the most about . what you do n't hear so much is all the general changes that have been made to the overall interface . the new icons are photo-realistic and size-scalable . they start out a little large , but you can set them to any size within a wide spectrum . the explorer windows have been radically redressed , with a new breadcrumbs backward navigation tool that beats the old address bar hands down ( you can retrace your steps in a logical , step-by-step manner , instead of using the cryptic addresses ) . also , they 're spruced up with decorations that recall the visual aura style of some of the new wallpapers . speaking of which , these are for the first time actually usable , unlike in previous versions of windows , where the wallpapers have been small and grainy . more general changes include the absence of menu bars in most areas of explorer , including ie . these can be replaced momentarily with a tap of the alt key , at least until you learn how to navigate without them . also , the animations are much better than in previous versions of windows , particularly the one you see when copying a file . in addition , the start menu has been reworked drastically . it does n't even say " start , " anymore ; instead , it 's simply a blue orb with the windows logo . the first big change is the way programs are accessed : gone is the delicate and finicky ever-expanding hierarchy system , where a slightly overzealous hand could miss the mark and close the entire desired level . now , the all programs button leads to an explorer-like listing of folders , each clearly named , and each of which opens and closes with a single mouse click . each time the start menu is opened , the folders reset themselves . also , they are automatically alphabetized . the start menu also contains most of the system links usually found on the desktop ( computer , documents , etc. ) , which is why the only thing on the desktop the first time you boot up is the recycle bin . and , in case you have seen screen shots or have tried out vista already , the search bar at the bottom pulls double duty as a replacement for the run command utility . speaking of search , though i seldom ever find myself wondering where my files are ( i suppose i 'm unique in this respect ) , many people have far more data to keep track of than me , and thus they will greatly appreciate the enhanced and pervasive searching facilities of vista . there are search boxes virtually everywhere in explorer , including the start menu . there is even one in ie7 , though it is not integrated with the system search . but , as you 've probably noticed , this is but a list of interface changes and additions . i assure you the list could go on and on , and i know i 'll receive more than one comment reminding me about some feature or other i 've forgotten . i 'll read those when they come and add material as necessary . but , aside from this , how does this new interface really impact the end user ? to be perfectly honest , though it 's certainly pretty and a few parts of it required a little adjustment , it did n't feel much different from previous windows versions to me . but , to be honest , this is a good thing . perhaps you 've heard that it 's a nightmare to learn vista . that 's a load of hogwash . a few things are renamed , a few things have been moved around , and on the whole everything looks prettier . but it 's still windows ; it accomplishes the same tasks and it works virtually the same as it always did . -included software bundle - taking a hint from apple , microsoft has included a compliment of digital media manipulation software . while of course ilife is superior , there is one issue that must be cleared up : ilife is not an integral part of mac os x as you may have been led to believe . older mac users must purchase it ; it only comes with the newer macs . therefore , microsoft windows vista , to be purely technical , offers the most comprehensive digital media suite ever offered stock with an os . however , technicality is seldom practical , and microsoft 's inclusion is no ilife killer . still , the included calendar ( new in vista ) , photo viewing and editing application ( new ) , windows media player 11 , windows movie maker , and windows dvd burning program ( new ) are nothing to scoff at . no , they wo n't replace dedicated , professional stand-alone programs , but let 's be honest : neither will ilife . the new internet explorer 7 is a step forward from the piece of swiss cheese ie6 was , insofar as security . new features include a phishing filter , tabbed browsing , and improved security . additionally , ie7 runs in protected mode , also called a " sandbox . " the idea is that this one application is cordoned off from the rest of the system , thereby making it more difficult for malicious software to take control of your computer . but that 's more for the security section of the review . the new ie7 is certainly more attractive than the older versions , and the version in vista offers enhanced visual appeal that the xp port of the software lacks . to be perfectly honest , i still use mozilla firefox ( mostly because i ca n't stand those blinking ads on web pages , and there is a firefox extension that gets rid of that annoyance once and for all ) , but if i had to , i would have no qualms using ie7. the new incarnation of window media player is really no different from the xp port . it still does n't support aac , and it still does n't handle gapless playback . as an ipod user and a progressive rock fan , respectively , i can gather only one thing from these shortcomings : it 's time to break out itunes . do n't get me wrong : wmp is not at all a bad tool . it 's still the default player on my system for most audio types . however , once an ipod owner and prog rocker , always an ipod owner / progger . i still say itunes is king , if only because its interface is cleaner , it supports my audio device , and it offers gapless playback . i have n't extensively tested the windows movie maker application , but i have read that it is updated very slightly from the xp version . the photo editing tool is completely new for vista , and after a little experimenting i was pleased that , though simple , the controls offer nice results . this application is on par with many of the basic image editing software packages you 'll see offered with digital cameras , printers , and the like . the other applications have yet to receive my testing , only because i do n't often burn dvd movies , and i have n't entered an event in a calendar in about ten years . as far as windows mail , i cannot be objective because i have never used outlook or outlook express . reports seem to indicate that windows mail is simply a dressed-up outlook express , with many of the same features . as i said , i have never used a mail program . call me old-fashioned , but i just check and write my mail from my internet browser . either way , i do n't honestly believe microsoft would offer outlook-level functionality in the stripped down version of outlook 2007. all in all , i was rather impressed at the steps microsoft has taken to embrace the digital media age . the effort falls short of ilife and proprietary solutions in this regard , but then , that is simply to be expected . i have n't really benefited tremendously from the new additions , but there is certainly nothing wrong with them , and i know many people will be very happy with this digital media suite . -security - this is the big picking point many people ( rightfully ) have with windows xp . it seems as though there 's at least two critical security updates every week . the mac commercials definitely have a point , but that 's only because macs make up so small a percentage of the market share ( though it is indeed a growing share ) that it is not advantageous for malware to be written for os x users . even so , xp does n't get a free pass here . something had to be done . and that something was the security measures taken in windows vista . the " sandbox " has already been mentioned above , but other features have been added . one of these , windows defender ( microsoft 's anti-spyware program ) , is one of those rare pieces of software that is just perfect : it may not be the best at what it does , but it 's unobtrusive , it 's simple to use , and it 's totally and completely free . leave it on to supplement your already existing spyware solution , and you can only benefit . also featured in vista is the now infamous user account control ( uac ) . basically , it prompts you every time your computer does basically anything , including installing programs , running some programs , updating settings , etc. and , if you were wondering , the mac commercials have it right : it really is that annoying . to be fair , you will see far fewer of these alerts once the bulk of your software has been installed , but until then you will be very , very sick of uac . i do n't advise this , but since i was able to get my anti-virus and anti-spyware software up and running on vista , i finally turned off uac . symantic seems to think this was unwise , but norton virus scan does n't bother me about it other than to recommend , on its information page , that i leave uac activated . yeah . like that 's going to happen . beyond these broad , tangible aspects of security , there is a lot of new stuff under the hood of vista that makes it less susceptible to malicious attacks . mostly , unless you 're very savvy , you do n't need to understand it all and , to be frank , do n't ask me because i have n't the foggiest how it all works . i 'm just glad it 's there . overall , i think microsoft has made a valiant effort with security . i would still not advise running any windows operating system without active virus and spyware protection , but at least vista has taken a step in the right direction . plus , you likely have anti-virus and anti-spyware software from running windows xp , which you can then install on vista . -the hardware - graphics : this is the part i have been waiting for . everything i read up until i finally installed vista told me i needed a dedicated graphics card with at least 256 mb of memory in order to run aero . i 'll be honest : i fell for it . i had a graphics card *in my hand* , but on the way to the checkout i realized i had left my gift certificate at home . so i decided to wait and see how my hardware would react . this is where i realized the utter bias among the tech community : i had absolutely no trouble running aero on integrated graphics . and that only makes sense because my setup is rather typical : a 17 " flat panel monitor and a modern computer . this will be what the majority of people have at the moment , and at this size , ig should have no trouble running aero . now use logic : if you want to run dual 24 " widescreen monitors , yeah , you 'll need a graphics card . especially since i do n't believe there even exists a dual monitor-capable ig motherboard ( if there is such a thing , it 's certainly not available on the oem consumer market ) . but if you have a fairly typical single monitor scenario on a computer that you bought within the past few years , you should have no trouble at all insofar as graphics . do n't be fooled . if you want to be absolutely sure , however , there is no harm- -and plenty of good sense- -in downloading microsoft 's free upgrade advisor utility to see if your setup is in any way deficient . plus , if you find you ca n't run aero for any reason , you were going to upgrade to vista anyway , so you can still buy dedicated graphics at that point . you do n't need the top-of-the-line card unless you want to make this an excuse to foray into gaming ; older technology that will get you up and running can be had for very reasonable prices . ram : there is one area , however , where many computers will be deficient : ram . oddly enough , while many sources are pushing the graphics card brigade , an almost equally strong force- -the computer manufacturers themselves- -seems to think that ram is no big deal . trust me : if you 've ever tried to run windows xp on 256 mb of ram , it 's a painful experience . that 's what vista is like on 512 mb- -you do n't even want to go there . dell is shockingly honest when they qualify the " minimum " vista requirement of 512 mb of ram ( as per microsoft ) as " great for booting the operating system , without running any applications or games . " this is where most people will have to upgrade their machines . 1 gb is perfectly acceptable ; if you want true multitasking power ( and you have the dual-core processor to support it ) , then go for 2 gb or more . for most people , however , 1 gb will be fine . my first of two vista machines has 1 gb and it works perfectly . i will warn you , though , that often times memory is installed in pairs , so your 512 mb is most likely two 256 mb modules . the paired method offers better performance , but it will make upgrading a system with only two memory slots somewhat expensive ( though not exorbitant by any means ) . but this is not somewhere you want to skimp , so at least one pair of 512 mb memory modules should be on your list of extra hardware if you have only 512 mb of memory currently installed . processor : this is perhaps the most accurate in terms of the hype . you 'll need at least a 1 ghz processor to run aero . many computers with such processors do n't even support 1 gb of ram , so if you 're in that situation , you will definitely be looking at a new computer with vista pre-installed . however , these are very old machines by this point , and most of us have something slightly newer . one myth that needs to be dispelled is that dual-core processors will run vista better than single-core cpus : vista is , for the most part , based on the microsoft server 2003 code , which is , in turn , based on the xp code , both of which came before the advent of multi-core processing . therefore , to the effect that the operating system is run , there will be only a marginal difference between a single-core or a dual-core cpu , provided both use identical core architectures . of course any applications that take advantage of multi-threading will benefit from multiple cores , but this was , is , and will always be the case , independent of the operating system . the question is simply whether you see yourself multitasking more with vista . if that 's the case , then a new computer with a dual-core processor installed is probably your best bet ; if you 're fine with your current setup , then it will most likely run vista and aero without any problems . it is interesting to note , however , that some upgrade aptitude utilities have some small quirks and will give conflicting and non-real results . for example , such a utility offered by advanced micro devices ( amd ) passed both my a64 x2-based machines without a hitch . however , when on a whim i ran it on my old p4-based desktop , the utility seemed to think that a 2.40b ghz pentium 4 northwood ( 533 fsb ) would be insufficient to run vista . i smell amd bias , even though i happen to favor amd over intel . just take what such utilities tell you with a grain of salt , and remember that microsoft 's own utility is likely the most reliable . generally , your processor will not be an issue when upgrading to vista . hard drive : again , this one is pretty straightforward . if you have a 40 gb hard drive or better , you 're good to go . and if you do n't have that , hard drives are so cheap these days that you could easily at least triple your current capacity for about what it costs to take the family out to dinner one evening ( amazon does not allow price figures , hence my vagueness regarding pricing throughout this review ) . things get interesting when you consider a dual boot scenario . this is when you have two operating systems running on the same system , either on the same or on different hard drives . in my honest opinion , this is the best way to go because you get to keep your current operating system ( just in case you run into problems with vista ) , and you also get to have vista . keep in mind that , in order to run vista on the same hard drive as your current os , you 'll need to install each os on a separate partition . you can either purchase a third party partitioning tool , or do what i did , which was use the ubuntu linux live boot disc 's built-in partitioning utility . of course there is risk involved with this last solution ( but , in my experience , i 've used it dozens of times with no problems ) , so do the latter only at your own risk . -compatibility - this is where most of the horror stories have come from . both hardware and software compatibility nightmares are flitting around in denser clusters than fish flies in june . up until recently , anti-virus and anti-spyware programs have been unable to install on vista . in addition , many proprietary printer applications are incompatible , yet the printer itself will often times function perfectly . graphics and sound card drivers still have n't really caught up , despite the fact that they 've had a little over two years to do so . i wo n't deny that , if your system just happens to roll the snake eyes , you 're in for some hell . but it 's not half as bad as you hear . i installed vista without a hitch ; there is a separate part of the process where the os scans the system for hardware , installs the necessary drivers , and then generates a list of anything that does n't install properly . every piece of hardware i had was recognized . in addition , my printer was recognized and installed in about five seconds , despite the fact that its own software would not install ( and that its maker , hp , still had n't posted a vista-compatible version ) . even my usb internet modem , which the upgrade advisor flat out said would not work with vista , installed and ran perfectly when i supplied the drivers from the manufacturer 's website . the fact is , vista has shipped with exponentially more drivers than any edition of xp . plus , it 's possible to supply drivers from manufacturers ' websites for the odd , esoteric bit of hardware that is n't immediately detected . sometimes it will work , sometimes not . but this is only to be expected when upgrading to a new os . i do n't seem to remember everything being rosy when xp came out , either . this is yet another item of strong support for a dual boot scenario . software is no different from hardware . all my software titles , with the possible exception of the ancient original roller coaster tycoon , work flawlessly with vista . and the latter did n't work with windows xp mce 2005 , either , so i do n't blame vista for this . if your software acts buggy or otherwise just wo n't work , check the manufacturer 's website . if it 's a fairly recent title , there will most likely be some compatibility patches or a whole new version of the application , all free of charge . just be ready to insert your product key , if required , in the latter case . now of course chances are that if you have some pet application from the mid-nineties , it might kick up a few dickens . again , a strong case for dual boot . the final and perhaps most prolific source of upgrade hell is , ironically , the upgrade itself . this process works by performing an in-place upgrade of an already existing operating system ( xp ) . these sorts of upgrades are notorious for problems , and the vista crop is no exception . however , since you 're currently viewing the full version page , this obviously is n't an issue for you . just remember , the best ways to install vista are either as a clean installation ( if necessary obliterating an existing os ) or a dual boot scenario . anything else and you might experience problems . but this has always been the case with in-place upgrades . -overall - i thank you for reading this far . most people won't . i know this was pretty long , but i wanted to get it all out there for people to read . vista is not a bad operating system . was i absolutely floored with it ? it may require some more time , but it has n't been the revelation microsoft promised . this is somewhat disappointing , and yet , somewhat reassuring as well . i did n't suffer any downtime because i could n't figure out how the operating system works , i did n't have any glaring compatibility issues , and my computer has worked virtually error-free ever since i first installed the os . in short , the change , while not mind blowing , was n't drastic or disturbing , either . at the end of the day , just remember : it 's windows . love it or leave it , it 's just microsoft 's operating system . vista will do the same thing as xp and earlier editions ; it 's not a source of inspiration or drive . it 's only as good as the person who 's using it .	5
this could have been an excellent documentary , but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly . this is particularly true in the way it depicts sparta as being some kind of womyn 's power state which is absurd . somewhat comically , the narrator enhances the story of sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus . she tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality . hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a " feminist wonderland , " but that 's exactly what is implied . i do n't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as : " fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother . " yeah right ! unless of course , husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal . pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful . to many counter-culturalists , history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program . unfortunately , that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work . as for bettany hughes , i agree that she is quite attractive , but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy . hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing sparta- -i 'll take victor davis hanson any day over her . i recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians .	2
all in all , i was really dissapointed ; i really enjoyed the king geedorah album . i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar , thematic , production , tolerable skits , and street-wise but deep lyrical content . doom is on the boards for about 1 / 3 of the tracks on ' escape.. . ' all have the stereotypical doom sound , with the only standout being ' 1 , 2...1 , 2. ' the x-ray produced tracks are minimal , but generally sound stiff , lacking much of a groove - thin synth lines , few sampled melodies . i did like ' warning ( kong ) , ' which has a nice , minimal , dark groove . the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound , pretty good . lyrical content is pretty bad , unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d$ &*.	4
i 've had my d70s for about a year now , have n't regretted it for a second . the controls are laid out logically , with everything to hand . the dual control wheels make adjustments fast and accurate . i personally love the optional grid overlay , i have no excuses for horizons that are n't horizontal . the wireless flash system is great , though you have to buy an sb-600 or sb-800 to get the full benefit . this camera is bigger and heavier than the d50 and d80 , which in my opinion is a positive thing .	1
this game is great ! after buying mia reading i thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning spanish since we live in a global village . they game was easy to load , easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners . the high quality 3d animation will blow you away . even my husband who learned 3d animation at the vancouver film school was blown away . the best part is , that they love playing it as they think it is a game . they forget they 're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences . well recommended	5
the problem with this film is i read the book . i was disappointed simply because ` be cool ' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent . the overly long dance sequence with john travolta and uma thurman is a prime example . somewhere the bulk of the story was lost- -and there are some very- -very good characters appearing in the film that would 've been more intersing if somebody would 've said , " hey , do n't forget the book ! " but being true to the original source is not hollywood 's strong suit . " be cool " provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , the movie would never have been made . a few laughs are provided . a couple ironic scenes show up , but there 's too little to sustain a full-length feature . basically , the project is a disservice to everyone involved . some of the characters are so thin- -face it- -poor christina milian as linda moon , is reduced to being a voice that sways when she sings- -a clichï¿½ . the rock does the best he can but again , ` he 's a gay bodyguard ; ' he 's the brunt of insulting jokes offered up by a raji , his boss [vince vaughn] , who , in the book , is far more sinister- -but in the film he 's an idiot . of course chili is chili . travolta does a very nice job , and chili 's obviously the smartest guy in the room . uma thruman 's performance is , well , not funny- -not serious , not intense- -not much- - at best , she made me shrug . i do like what harvey keitel did with nick carr , but there 's just not enough , and all the negatives reflect completely on the director . enough said there . my advice , watch ` get shorty'again , or read ` be cool .

there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama / revenge films such as eye for an eye . it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised . they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end , whilst the victim or top-billed actor / actress comes out as the hero at the end . it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort , but for this critic it is getting old . eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film . from the opening credits of this film , you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end . the pauses could be guessed , the lines could have been written the night before , and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best . it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic , the violins would always shrill around kiefer , and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere . this is your typical revenge film with no excitement , no frills , nothing that would make it stand out from the rest . the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films , which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end . where did eye for an eye go wrong ? i do n't think i need to count all the ways for you , but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters . i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic . what was sally field 's job ? i know that is a small detail , but it better highlights my complaint that our central family ( the mccanns ) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen . i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death , yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed . ed harris literally walked through his character , proving that field 's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion . the only character worth watching , and was developed briefly , was kiefer . he was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end . yet , we did n't even know that much about him either ( which upset me ) . schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well , the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably did n't even need to read the script , and the story played it safe from the beginning , but it was n't what i wanted to see . i expected film like this to come out during the 80s , not in 1996. it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris , sally field , phillip baker hall , keith david , and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan . nothing stood out in this film , nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it , and nothing made me feel excited about these actors . this was a literal " nothing " film . it lent nothing to the cinematic world except ( and i stress this a bit ) another peg in a very tired genre known as the " revenge thriller " . after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it , overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements , which made me think of a high school drama production . it was amateur at best , but she said that is why directors use sally , because she is known for being overly dramatic . this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly . sally saw success with it once , but as she continues it only creates bad cinema . there were times during sally 's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing . i could n't help myself , but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike . the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he does n't have to play the outlaying father any further in films . he was completely wasted in this film . was there any emotion with him ? i did n't see any . then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue , but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes . also , did mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½ ? urg , his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers . again , the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil , but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile . it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end . if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself . field over dramatized the entire film , thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer . did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil ? that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel , but alas , ole safe schlesinger did n't take us down that darker path . i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups , but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers . this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored . i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast , yet we chose to stay on the lighted path . that , coupled with the poor acting , just created a film that did n't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world . overall , in case it was n't obvious , this was n't a good movie at all . in fact , i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again . i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again , but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the " revenge thrill " fell into that same pattern . the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure , this film did not . sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight , while everyone else was forgettable . the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil . watch this film for kiefer , but nothing else . skip it ! grade : * out of ****	2
if you live in an old building where the toilet is always getting clogged by your abundant use of regular toilet paper , then this is the brand and variant you should switch to . if i were to objectively judge it by what it promises ( rapidly dissolves.. . ) , i 'd have to give it five stars . it practically melts as soon as it touches water . do n't expect to be able to use it for mopping water off the sink ; you 'll just end up with a mess of dissolved tissue . i 'm giving it only four stars , because it 's not my favorite toilet paper ( that would be charmin ultra ) , but the necessary choice .	3

i got this for my s70. first off , in order to use it , you have to set the s70 to " radio control " ( about 9 button pushes ) . then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so ( and only in *front* of the camera-the remote does n't work from the rear ! ) . oh , and if you want to adjust your framing , forget it-the zoom is immobilized . if you need a " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using the self-timer built into the camera . it gives you 2-second and 10-second settings , and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time .	1
' introducing postmodernism ' is a good source to gather names of philosophers , architects , artists , anthropologists , linguists , and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to pm . the problem , and it is a big one , is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines . sure , if you only have half an hour to read up on pm , you can whip through this book and go on with your life . but if you 're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon , and perhaps go on to read more , this book is not the place to start . check out david harvey 's ' condition of postmodernism . ' this will rip the top of your head clean off ! it 's much more weighty ( in every sense of the word ) , but your understanding of pm will vastly improve , and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the ' genre '	0
after doing a bunch of research , i bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective sony ccd that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had . the first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations . after a few days of that , the camera dies completely . the second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease . one camera . . . a fluke maybe . but two ? that suggests a real problem so beware .	1

it 's to bad i ca n't give negative stars as this package certainly deserves them . this program is total garbage . a gargantuan waste of both time and money . seemingly with every menu change , it recatalogues your entire photo collection , on all drives , which takes hours ( like 12+ ) to accomplish . and , while it will scan and catalogue all of the drives on your computer , do n't even think about selecting a folder and expecting it to display the contents of that folder and all of it 's subfolders . ai n't a gonna happen.. . but is will happily go through and catalogue them again for you , but , of course , after waiting hours for the software to finish catalogueing , it does n't display the contents . no , that would be way to logical . after realizing that my computer had slowed to a crawl , i checked the memory usage and found that the corel photo album 6 deluxe was using 6 to 7 times higher than any other program running , and that includes norton internet security , a notorious memory hog ! guess we now know what the deluxe part is ! as far as i am concerned , corel photo album 6 deluxe is neither intuitive nor is it the " best of " anything . it is a creeping , bloated dinosaur and a total waste of your hard earned money .	5

disappointing to see a man of garbarek 's gifts drift inexorably towards artistic middle-age and the lure of mor classical and soft world-beat markets . no one expects him to do a ' jazz ' album nowadays but after a six-year recording hiatus we might have expected some innovation and sharpness in the settings he chooses . sadly , the evidence on this release is of an artist who 's content to mine the same musical territory for about 15 years now to the point of exhaustion ; theres nothing here he has n't said better on his previous three or four outings . all is not lost though , and there are moments of stark beauty here and there but they are mostly lost in a soft sticky morass of garbarek cliches and the kind of uninspired composition better suited to a film soundtrack or tv documentary about some beautiful natural environment . forget the misleading hype elsewhere and get hold of just about any of his albums from about 1972 through to 1987 and i guarantee you 'll feel better for it	4

this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era , that of border radio . brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas / mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america - one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio . these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an ' x' . this spawned an industry of singers , politicians , preachers and pitchman the type we now see on & quot ; infomercials&quot ; . mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you & quot ; pulled&quot ; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - & quot ; keep those cards and letters coming ! & quot ; new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev . ike - & quot ; get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo ! & quot ; this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio , salesmanship , and american sub-cultures and the bizarre	0

in an attempt to meet more girls , i took french many , many years ago when i was still in junior high school ( middle school to you young ' uns ) . in class , my french teacher treated us to a film screening of jean cocteau 's la belle et la bete ( beauty and the beast ) . truthfully , back then , i did n't think much of it other than being something too " arty . " but , over the past two decades , i 've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it . la belle et la bete is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema . it 's certainly cocteau 's masterpiece . without a doubt , it provided the direct inspiration for disney 's oscar-nominated version , as well as greatly influencing cbs 's 1987 beauty and the beast television series . jean cocteau took madame leprince de beaumont 's classic story , adapted it , and put his own stamp on it . cocteau 's artistic vision is dazzling to behold . the viewer is treated to a delectable visual feast replete with disturbingly aware statues , ghostly arms jutting out of walls to clutch candles , vocal household objects , jewelry which turns to rubbish , etc. but nicely juxtaposed with the imaginative , surrealistic trappings are the more mundane sequences revolving around belle 's family , which serve to somewhat ground the fairy tale to a more reality-based semblance . this atmospheric film was given an enormous lift by the very wonderful performances of the two leads , josette day and jean marais . josette day , as belle , her most luminous role , personified beauty , grace , and class . jean marais , on the other hand , made women and young girls swoon in his dual roles as the handsome scoundrel avenant and the tortured but gentle-hearted beast . in fact , marais portrayed the fearsome beast in such a sympathetic and romantic light that , in the end , when the hirsute and awful monster was transformed into the handsome prince , cocteau and marais actually received many letters of complaint . the women much preferred their kindly beast . ************************************************************ the criterion collection 's high-definition , crystal clear digital transfer is awesome to experience , lending a lushness and clarity that was lacking in the older , grainier copies . this film is also well-stocked with special features : - 2 audio commentaries - a philip glass opera soundtrack option - " screening at the majestic " - a 1995 documentary featuring interviews with the cast and crew - interview with the film 's director of photography henri alekan - " secret professionels : tete a tete " ( professional secrets : face to face ) - the title of a french television show , of which particular 1965 episode showcases makeup artist hagop arakelian , who worked on la belle et la bete - the original trailer - the restoration trailer - film restoration segment - stills gallery - a booklet which includes jean cocteau 's notes on the film and a reprinted translation of madame leprince de beaumont 's original fable .	2
i 've bought several lenses from adorama , two of which include a new 300 / 2.8 is and the other , this 500 / 4 is . all of their deliveries were prompt and well packed . i have zero complaints with them . i dealt the john ( green , i think is his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . as for this lens , it is incredible . wide open it creates a wickedly sharp subject against a wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af is very fast . this lens is extremely good and will still af when used with the 1.4x converter .

i have to say that i really wanted to like this camera . it takes good pictures and the ultra-wide lens is a nice feature . it is quite compact and has a nice screen . the software is reasonably good and has a nice presentation to the user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here 's the bad stuff : 1 ) in the first shipment i got , the normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) did n't work . the images were garbled and almost unrecognizable . the ultra-wide images were fine . i attributed it to getting a random lemon and returned it for an even exchange . the second v570 i got from amazon worked fine until about 5 months later and then the normal mode crapped out on me . so , i do n't think it is just a random problem . there appears to be a reliability issue with the non-wide angle part of this camera since it seems statistically unlikely that i would randomly get two cameras with the exact same problem . my v570 is now a nice-looking paperweight and i use a casio exilim ex-z70. 2 ) the stand seemed nice at first until it came time to travel . you have to unhook the whole thing and lug it around with you if you want to charge your camera or download pictures and movies without a card reader dongle . also , since you have to charge the battery in the camera , you ca n't charge a spare battery while you are taking pictures with the other . for comparison , my new casio ex-z70 has a usb cable that is easy to stick in the pocket of my bag and has an external battery charger . so , if one battery is dead i can leave it behind in the charger while i take pictures with the spare . 3 ) the movies that you take with this camera are stored in mov format instead of avi or mpeg . while it does play in most pcs if you have installed quicktime , it is not supported by my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) and is difficult to work with in the video editor / dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i ca n't say how widely mov is supported compared to avi and mpeg , but that format created problems for me . so , i applaud kodak for not clinging to the sinking boat anchor of the photographic film business and going digital . but i think a few more usability studies and more attention to reliability would help make this a winner in future iterations	1
after a week of using this i find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing . mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect , so maybe the motor was already fixed : - ) my mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender . the zr 500 is ok in low light , but you can adjust the exposure manually to correct if it is n't to your liking . you can also adjust the focus too ! my friend who is a mini dv guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par . i 've made two practice dvd 's ( with firewire , no problem at all ) with this camera and like what i see . for those of you that have bad motornoise : try your video software to edit the noise out . power director has that feature . i am happy with this product , but i would rather have a higher end model now that i have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder . a great camcorder for beginners !	1
do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done- -in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us " printing " to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's " option " for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the " convert to adobe pdf " button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose " this feature will not be available " from the " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used " convert to adobe pdf " and " combine in acrobat.. . " entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( " adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally " ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc. ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the " improvements " in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )	5
whether you 're planning to read through crowley 's book of thoth for the first time , or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it , this book is going to be equally useless to you . several of crowley 's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly , but sadly that 's the only good thing about this book . the book is filled with a lot of fluff . duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley 's and harris ' lives , and constantly excuses and defends crowley 's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper . duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley 's works , so perhaps its some sort of atonement . but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley 's character . through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems . having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid . unfortunately duquette does n't do this . his background information is base and scarce . he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah , but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this , duquette does n't give nearly enough information to understand crowley 's works , and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere . as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley 's work , duquette outright fails . at times it seems as if duquette does n't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck . i do n't think the man even understands tarot in general ( and duquette 's own tarot deck is evidence of this too ) . at his best , duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth . typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette 's work , a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level . reading through the book of thoth , there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better . crowley 's phonetic translation of the i ching does n't follow the current standard , and sometimes the differences are confusing , especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching . a key showing crowley 's translation and the standard translation would 've been helpful . likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology , despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth , and what he did write is hard to find . a chapter explaining crowley 's views on astrology would 've been great . if that was n't possible , then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful . however duquette 's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read . duquette 's book is n't useful as a reference to crowley 's work . duquette does n't seem to understand crowley most of the time , and fails to adequatley explain crowley 's ideas . besides some new-agey nonsense , like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays , duquette does n't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley 's work . except for a few nice diagrams ( which are common enough and easy to find ) , there is n't anything worthwhile contained in this book . at least not anything you wo n't get out of reading crowley 's book of thoth	0
my bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and , being a light sleeper , i 've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber . it does n't help that my husband ( god love him ) snores as loud as a small jet plane . i 've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like i have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light . i received the tranquility zone eye mask for a birthday present and i could hardly wait to try it . i love this thing ! it 's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and , due to the design , the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears . the sounds are pleasant ( i 'm a big fan of the " babbling brook " track ) and i love being able to plug my mp3 player in so i can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i 've given this 5 stars because there 's no option for 4.5. in all honesty , there are a few drawbacks . first , when i say this is thick i 'm not kidding . without my a / c in the summer it might get a bit warm . second , the sound clips themselves are on very short loops.. . so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you 're hearing you 'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . were it not for this i 'd be a bigger fan of the first track - - the one that sounds like you 're in a forest - - but i get distracted ( and awakened ) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades . even with these things in mind , i have to say i have n't slept this well in years . i love this thing , and i wish i 'd found it earlier . in fact , i love it so much i 've given it as a gift to two friends who 'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it , too	3
2 1 / 2 stars . this is a very good concert teaming up a pre - " grammy " santana with wayne shorter of weather report fame . great rhythm section , drums , conga , timbale . top notch musicians , first rate performance , very entertaining . my big problem comes with the quality of the dvd . i do n't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states dd 2.0 , dd 5.1 and dts , the menus are showing something else ( dd2.0 , dts 2.0 and dts 5.1 ) but neither dts stream seem to be working . only dd stereo works . i own close to 200 dvd 's and all work fine , dts and all . bought it directly from amazon , i had it replaced and the new one is the same . this is not part of the great live at montreux series productions which are all great , no matter how old the concert is . so the 2 1 / 2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star dvd quality .	2

i wo n't include my website url here , but i 'm a professional photographer , who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions . i 've been using photoshop since version 5.0 , roughly 6-7 years . frankly , i 'm surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of photoshop cs2 , and that overall the product only gets three stars . i understand all the frustration , though . even on a top-of-the-line machine , " ps cs2 " can be slow at times . however , in my case , that 's because i 'm working on incredibly large files . for example , my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images . by the time multiple layers are added in ps , one image file can be 500 mb - 1 gb in size . this is exactly why i have a dual-opteron system with 4 gb of ram : so i can work on these monster files in photoshop ! for me , photoshop is a must-have . there are *no* alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what i want to get done . i do n't even want to mention all the advanced features that i use on a daily basis , frankly because that 's part of my edge as a professional . i 've spent over five years working in ps everyday , and have carefully studied several advanced books on ps . the learning curve is long , but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards . yeah , adobe 's got some major improvements to make , along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned . for me , the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory . and i would agree with other reviewers here that for most people , the full photoshop cs2 is probably a waste of money . photoshop elements is probably a better way to go , though i have n't used it personally . i know a good web designer who uses paint shop pro , and who seems to be happy . imho , some people are probably drawn to photoshop the way others are drawn to autocad or solidworks or 3d studio max . all these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user . you ca n't make a career out of ps elements , or paint shop pro , or gimp , or whatever else other reviewers may mention . ps cs2 is " the standard " for image manipulation	5

they just do n't have movies like this anymore . this is not a movie that makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen . this is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past . charlie sheen stars as a man who volutarily goes to war . this seems odd and he figures out why everyone was looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie . he finds out alright . keith david plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role . he cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked . the supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here . overall this is my favorite movie of all time . it has stood the test of time and never fails when i want to see a good movie . i just have the old special edition , not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice . it has a commentary from the direcotor and a seperate one from the military advisor who worked on the film . there is also a lengthy doumentary about the making of and when i saw this i was mroe than glad i got the special edition . you would nto believe what the actors went through ! it is a great making of .	2
for the longest time , i have thought that observational truths were highly prone to being the most piercing of things : i have believed that the truth could either hurt ( or disturb ) you terribly , or make you laugh so hard , to the point of hysteria- -or a combination of both extremes . there are many things to put this theory to the test , but to cut it all short , all one would need to do ( if by chance it has n't been done already ) is experience the observational humor of richard pryor to possibly get a better understanding of what i am talking about . this classic comedy album from 1975 is a prime example . richard pryor has been hailed as a genius by many , and i would have to agree : it takes plenty of intelligence and natural talent to be a comedian for starters , but to also turn many disturbing observational truths of everyday life into something painfully , body-breakingly hilarious takes a whole lot of something as well . from the very beginning , to the tail-end of this cd , 1975 's _is it something i said ? _ is a non-stop laugh fest , that personally gets *me* laughing so loud and hard , i end up pretty much abusing almost every part of my body in the process : my throat , my lungs , my sides , my stomach- -they all end up feeling beaten and worn-out . richard 's takes on drugs , sex , race & racism , relationships , and politics in general are every bit as painfully observational as they are profane- -and did i mention hilarious ? the racy quality of the material found here makes so much of what 's referred to as " cutting-edge " these days , seem so contrived and unaffecting ; richard 's observations seem just as relevant now- -if not more so- -as they were 30 years ago . i could n't be graphic in pointing out some of the sickeningly funny moments on this disc - - and there are many - - but i should say that the opening one-two punch of " eulogy , " and " shortage of white people , " and richard 's take on his own battle with cocaine addiction in the " cocaine " bit get me cracking up so hysterically , i sometimes need to be careful not to make myself sick . and again , those are just a few of the many hysterical blasts found here . richard pryor is considered a comedic legend for a reason . this album here is a good example as to why he is considered as such . just do n't play it for the kids , and for the love of god *don't * play it during the middle of the night ; you most certainly will disturb the beauty rest of your family , and your neighbors . and you know what could happen if you disturb one person 's beauty rest : just imagine what would happen if you disturbed the beauty rest of many. .	4

for the english-language reader wedgwood 's book , which has been in print for over sixty years , is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of european history . it gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations : the principal antagonists at the outset - - ferdinand ii of austria and frederick v , elector palatine ; the condottieri-style generals - spinola , von mansfeld , tilly , wallenstein , piccolomini , christian of halberstadt , bernhard of saxe-weimar , the duc d'enghien ( conde ) ; the contentious minor rulers - - maximilian v of bavaria , johann georg of saxony ; the northern monarchs - - christian iv of denmark and gustavus adophus of sweden ( and his daughter christina and prime minister , oxenstierna ) ; the " spoiler " , cardinal richelieu ; the new emperor ferdinand iii and his cousin , the warlord cardinal-infant ferdinand of spain ; and many others . this book is written in a traditional english historian 's prose style that is clear , eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories , while still covering these aspects of the period . in spite of some reviewers ' claims of a " protestant bias " in her interpretation , the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war , taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of the participants ( dynasties , rulers , generals and paymasters ) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of germany and bohemia . although i am not familiar with this new edition ( and grafton 's introduction ) i emphasize that any reissuing of this book should have a brief scholarly introduction which supplies more details on the constitutional arrangements and crises of the holy roman empire during the sixteenth century , with a special emphasis on the composition of the bohemian estates and the conflicts between the estates and the habsburg king-emperors . the extent and internal organization of " the bohemian crown lands " should also be outlined . a succinct review of the political status of lutheranism , calvinism , the bohemian brethren , and other protestant confessions throughout all of europe around the year 1600 and a note on how their status had altered by 1700 would also be useful in " setting the stage " for the events of 1618 and understanding the relgious-denomination consequences of the war . the author supplies sufficient details on the major battles , but this is not a work of military history . as wedgwood knows , battles were only significant in the larger view as a result of their political consequences . and it is in the elucidation of the underlying politics of the war ( including how political prospects shifted with the waxing and waning of military fortunes ) that wedgwood excels . in her analysis of the general european situation at the outset of the war she proposes that there were three sets of forces which underlay and drove contemporary events . each was a source of conflict and each might cross-cut the others , complicating the declared interests and objectives of the dynasties and nations involved . in brief , the forces were : ( a ) religion , with three major competing factions ( catholic , lutheran , calvinist ; she notes that the conflict between the latter two forms of protestantism was often as extreme as it was between each of them and the roman catholic church ) . ( b ) nationalism ( french , german , czech , etc. ) , which was a new force on the scene , crystallizing the idea that political entities might be defined by nationality ( which here equals some combination of ethnicity and native language ) rather than conceived of as polyglot territorial agglomerations brought about by dynastic interests . ( c ) monarchic-constitutional issues , which were especially complicated and ambiguous within the " constitutional " grouping of major and minor powers known as the holy roman empire ( hre ) . the constitutional problem was twofold . within the small arenas of developing nation states and the yet smaller ones of traditional rulerships throughout europe ( duchies , counties , " free-city " areas ruled by town councils and mayors ) contests over the basis and extent of the rulers ' powers and privileges were taking place . aristocrats , oligarchs and merchants had traditional corporate bodies ( estates ) reluctant to cede their own powers ( taxation , the organization of military service ) to a central authority . the same conflict was also being played out on the larger scale of the hly roman epire , that loose grouping of special obligations and exemptions which was the final residue of an earlier system of vassalage binding together the elected emperor ( who had been a habsburg for several centuries ) and the smaller rulerships of central europe . the religious reforms , rebellions and wars of the sixteenth century had produced a system that appeared to resolve some of the potential problems through the won privilege of cujus regio , eius religio ( " whoever rules , his religion [is the religion of the ruled area] " ) . in the year of the war 's inception , 1618 , this new balance was very fragile , comprising four catholic and three protestant imperial electors . in germany the special arrangements regulating relationships between the emperor ( resident in vienna or prague ) and local rulers and guaranteeing a great deal of political autonomy to the locals , especially the protestant electors , had been somewhat codified by the augsburg treaty of 1555 , and were known as the " german liberties " . these would prove to be especially important to the three protestant electors at the outset of the war . in the developing continental war one could be pro - or anti-habsburg based on any one of the above factors or any combination of two or three of them . for example , a catholic ruler ( including the papacy ) might seek protestant allies in order to combat habsburg territorial expansion in his direction or to combat constitutional changes in the empire which affected his position adversely . or a protestant power might accept the habsburg " program " in any given case because it did not wish to disturb constitutional arrangements that were to its advantage ( this characterization is apt for saxony and brandenburg during the first twelve years of the war . ) as wedgwood notes , all three considerations ( religion , nationality , constitutional relations ) could be and were used cynically to advance the positions and interests of individual rulers and factions . from the point of view of rationality or predictability , political choices and commitments were often self-contradictory ( e.g. , a catholic power supporting a protestant venture ; a german liberties party accepting occupation by the army of a foreign power , etc. ) or temporary expedients that made the overall european situation more chaotic . the war began locally in bohemia , but its complications and consequences radiated outward as far west as spain and england ( even farther , to the caribbean naval theater ) , as far north as sweden and northeast to poland , as far south as italy and southeast as transylvania ; in other words , it was a european continental war with global impact . when the war broke out in 1618 it was over the habsburg violation of a " constitutional guarantee " of religious freedom in bohemia ( the concessions stated in rudolf ii 's letter of majesty ) . and here is where individual personalities and beliefs played an important role . ferdinand ii , who had knowingly violated the terms of the letter soon after being selected by the bohemian diet as king ( and therefore the first in precedence of the hre electors ) was determined not only to expand the political powers of the habsburg dynasty in bohemia and elsewhere , he was firmly committed to the goals of the catholic counter-reformation ( i.e. , re-catholicizing all of the areas within the hre which had become protestant during the last one hundred years ) . when he was deposed by a special convention of the bohemian estates ( the defenestration of his deputies in prague being the signal event of this deposition ) , the crown of bohemia was offered to the elector of the ( rhineland ) palatinate , frederick v , who considered himself a champion of the protestant cause . the religious zeal of these two antagonists led to extreme fixed positions at the very outset of the war . given the other major conflict hovering in the background - - the spanish habsburg determination to recover the now protestant area of the netherlands which had become the successful and defiant ( dutch ) united provinces - the war soon became international . while the entry of france and then denmark followed by sweden , into the war during the 1620 's changed its nature and extended its duration , wedgwood concentrates much of her analysis on the behavior of the two protestant electors , johann georg of saxony and georg wilhelm of brandenburg and one catholic ruler , maximilian of bavaria . it is her contention throughout the book that johann georg and maximilian in particular could have prevented the war 's spread and forced ferdinand into a compromise very early in the course of events that acquired their own dynamism once they got out of hand . despite their religious differences these two were always strong " german liberties " proponents , and each had the same view of the austrian habsburg rulers : they should be kept for the broader protections they offered , but kept in place with respect to encroachments on the traditional rights of local rulers . in the end both of these rulers survived the lengthy war in spite of numerous diplomatic and military reversals ( saxony switched sides and joined the swedes for several years , while maximilian 's position was constantly and secretly supported by his nominal enemies , the french , as their potential foot in the habsburg camp . ) wedgwood believes that the price of their survival was far too costly for the rest of germany . wedgwood 's gloss on the changing nature of the conflict is that by the year 1635 the war had become one of great-power politics , and that the earlier religious and ideological causes were losing their ability to motivate the antagonists . her summary of the changes emphasizes the following : ( a ) religion had discredited itself as a plausible source of political programs and a legitimate cause for war . religion was becoming more interiorized and private , and losing ground philosophically and ethically to the new prestige of empirical and applied science ( this was the era of galileo and kepler , with descartes , harvey , hook , newton , huygens , etc. on the near horizon ; a time of laboratory science and scientific societies . ) as the basis of a political program religion was viewed cynically by those who saw the devastation it had brought about . ( b ) for thinking men , nationalism began to fill the emotional void in public life left by the withdrawal of religion as the underlying motive for political and cultural action . this was very obvious in france , but even true of ferdinand iii , for whom the new main cause was the construction of an austrian-based hereditary monarchy whose additional obligations as the holy roman imperial protector of far-flung german catholics were no longer perceived as worthwhile . in the minds of both germans and austrian habsburgs the holy roman empire was becoming an honorific entity with ambiguous and weak political commitments in germany . the elbe-north german-pomeranian ideal empire of wallenstein was never again revived as a dynastic program . austria began to move south and east ( toward italy , croatia , and hungary ) in its expansionist aims . ( c ) the control of immense polyglot , multi-religious , mercenary armies and their huge camp followings had become a pressing matter of concern for all of the political authorities that hired them - they were neither religious nor national in their motives and aims and were in fact independent " mobile states " unto themselves , cynical and rapacious and often as dangerous to their paymasters as to their foes ; whenever their immediate prospects for pay and maintenance looked bad , they changed sides . the most successful mercenary generals had become mini-sovereigns . officers were all " out for themselves " and for their troops ( rather than for the cause or nation of their paymaster ) , since without troop loyalty they had no means of personal advancement - - the most famous commanders , ernst von mansfeld , wallenstein , bernhard of saxe-weimar , the swedish general wrangel , all expected ( and some received ) grants of territory and titles of nobility as their rewards for service . the " national " armies of conscripts that came to the fore in the 18th century was the answer to this problem . the pace of the war wound down during its last five years ( although there were several major battles fought even then ) , which was a period of extended negotiatons in münster and osnabrück , with the " final treaty " being signed late in 1648. for the next five years a series of conferences met at nürnberg to implement and enforce the peace treaty and to deal with difficult problems raised by demobilizing huge armies . many of the loans of this period , which were raised to cover the demobilization costs , were not paid off for a century . individual rulers such as charles of lorraine and the duke of savoy ( who got nothing from the treaty ) refused to vacate various fortresses for five or six years , but the war did not break out again . france and spain continued at war with each other , but not in germany . numerous soldiers , especially officers , went into mercenary service all over europe . others took to the hills as professional bandits - for the next 20 years merchants traveled through certain parts of germany and bohemia in armed caravans . wedgwood accepts the more recent ( 1900-1930 's ) historical estimate that the population of the imperial german lands ( excluding alsace and the netherlands ) dropped from about 21 million in 1618 to 13 million in 1648. the number of dislocated people was also substantial . while she acknowledges that the number of towns and villages destroyed and other " infrastructural " and economic losses were very large , she feels that all contemporary sources ( e.g. , the pamphlet literature of the next 100 years ) exaggerated local losses , since all parties in the war continued to seek indemnities and restitution . the free peasantry benefited briefly , since landowners were desperate for manpower to restore their estates - prices fell while wages rose for a number of years , which increased the standard of living of peasants and artisans . but within a decade of the peace treaty the landowning gentry was pleading with imperial , royal and local rulers to impose legal restrictions which would re-create bonded , serf-like conditions for peasants . town councils now became pawns and bureaucrats of the dynastic courts of their rulers and also implemented restrictive legislations on peasants ( e.g. , prohibitions against mobility , domestic industry , and household craft production - - a trend which later historians refer to as " neo-serfdom " ) . class stratification was as rigid as it was before the war started . there was a new , large class of mobile petty nobles and gentry seeking court-backed military and bureaucratic appointments , at the expense of town and peasant taxpayers . germany and the austrian-based monarchy and empire were totally excluded from the international competition to establish overseas colonies and from the developing " atlantic trade " . for a number of years the outlets of germany 's major rivers ( rhine , elbe , oder , and for brandenburg-prussia , vistula ) were controlled by foreign powers , reducing germany 's commercial strength . hamburg was the exception , becoming the major maritime merchant city of the north sea coast , at the expense of the other hanseatic cities and the scandinavian powers . the only medium-sized german state to emerge with positive prospects was brandenburg , soon to become the administratively efficient and militarily powerful prussia . the peace , while ending the " wars of religion " , set the stage for a long series of " nationalistic " wars that subsumed dynastic and religious sources of conflict . france replaced the habsburg spanish-austrian coalition as the menacing and tyrannical continental power willing to disturb the peace . austria turned to the south and east and spain lost its great power status and became an economic and cultural backwater . there was no politically or culturally unified germany within the boundaries of the old empire ( french culture began to reign supreme ) and the cosmopolitanism ( its openness to outside influences ) of this area during the 18th century , instead of being a source of pride over its achievements , became a source of lament for later cultural and ethnic purists of revived german nationalism . author 's judgment and conclusions : in terms of responsibility for the overall disaster , wedgwood points to the futility and self-destructiveness of sincere religious zeal in the cases of ferdinand ii and the elector palatine . but , from the point of view of failures of practical ( and ethical ) politics , she highlights the behavior of maximilian and johann georg , who could have prevented the spread of the conflict in 1620 and could have brought the war to an early end in 1635 if they had agreed to work together on a " unified german program " which would have forced imperial compromises and concessions had they both stood behind it . between these two she sees the saxon as the greater victim of military circumstances ( pressed by the swedish juggernaut ) and therefore less culpable for the mess , while she judges the bavarian as too subtle and too ambitious in pursuit of his own dynastic and territorial ambitions at the expense of a general settlement good for his fellow germans , thus identifying him as the more culpable . beautiful in its style and concision , wedgwood 's final summary is also gloomy ( as one might expect of a work completed in 1939 , on the verge of world war ii ) : " as there was no compulsion towards a conflict which , in despite of the apparent bitterness of the parties , took so long to engage and needed so much assiduous blowing to fan the flame , so no right was vindicated by its ragged end . the war solved no problem . its effects , both immediate and indirect , were either negative or disastrous . morally subversive , economically destructive , socially degrading , confused in its causes , devious in its course , futile in its result , it is the outstanding example in european history of meaningless conflict .

this is basically a commercial pitch for dr. murad 's spas and products . unless you are planning on buying his regime , he gives very , very scant information about how you could accomplish the program using other , less expensive products . do n't expect an easy how-to giving you day by day advice of supplements and skin care . it 's not here . i decided to buy this based on other 's good reviews . now i 'm thinking that they were written by employees . i was very disappointed	0
i loved the camera , absolutely loved it . i was using it one night and it died . i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened . the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying . the second time i used it , i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger . i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures . as i was looking at the pictures , it just shut off . i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose . i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine .	1
very rich in music , fully orchestrated and full of energy . i highly recommend this album for everyone who loves new age music and to all those who like classical music . david took it to another level on this one . i myself like new age artists that incorporate orchestra to their music and that is why i loved this album . if you like this album , i recommend you to explore yanni , secret garden , giovanni and bernward koch	4

being familiar with some adobe products , we opted to try this at work as a cheaper alternative than some other packages for simple web graphics work . boy , were we disappointed . simply put , this tool is not so much a tool , but a hindrance . utilities such as transparencies , are not only difficult to make work properly , but hidden in non-intuititve locations . dialogs are non-standard , which requires getting used to strange layouts in design . while seeminly small for just a couple items i 've mentioned , multiply this by the supposed feature set of the product and you start to get an idea of how cumbersome the tool really is . as has been mentioned by plenty of other people , it is also slow . if you want a simple image viewer , find anything else - even freeware , as i have never come across an image utility that takes so long to load , regardless of it is the first time or the umpteenth time . while i could go on about the unsatisfactory qualities of this product , i will simple reiterate what others had also said ; it is cumbersome to use , slow to use and load , un-intuitive with poor layout and design , and lacks many basic features one would expect in this form of utility .	5

all " style " and no substance . even the dance number with john travolta & uma thurman was lackluster . and would cedric the " entertainer " please go away ? i 've never seen anything with him in it that was any good . i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud . i think christina milian 's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over .	2
i have had this heating pad for over a year and am very pleased with it . the auto shut off is annoying when i forget to reset the pad and it goes completely cool but otherwise , very pleased . just ordered one for my grandma and she is thrilled with the soft cover and the fact that it does n't " rattle " like the old fashioned ones . great improvment and larger size	3
nero 6 is a wonderful product , but you need to get a legal copy of the full retail version , not an oem cd or a cd of questionable origin . at this time ( april 2006 ) the best place to get it is from the ahead software website ( the makers of nero ) . ( you can get a retail box of nero 7 just about anywhere , but nero 6.6 seems to be more stable and provides all the functionality most users will need . ) you can download a demo , then purchase a serial number to unlock the full product . it 's a smooth , easy transaction . after many headaches i discovered that the oem version that came with my dvd burner would allow me to capture video from my camcorder , but would n't let me burn them to dvds . my choice was to either buy a cd of questionable origin ( and one that is almost certifiably illegal ) on ebay , purchase a dvd burning plug-in from ahead software for $24.99 , or purchase the whole suite for $80.00. i chose the latter . using my installed oem version , i purchased the serial number , entered it into the product ( very easy to do ) , then downloaded the latest updates , and i was off and running . this software produces very high quality dvds and can burn a disk in 15 to 20 minutes using an inexpensive 16x nec dvd burner . i am now a happy consumer with a stack of dvds containing transferred videos of great quality	5
i bought this book before my first trip to austria . i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations . that turned out to be true . what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong-minded and independent and organize their homelife well , although many go to work ? this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english-speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach . it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language ( especially viennese ) and useful info about festivals . mostly , though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends . i would quote it as an iron-clad authority when their behavior did n't quite match the book 's version and thereby amused them tremendously . - -lynn hoffman , author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books.isbn 978160164000	0
i mainly bought this to go on the end of the lens adapter for the s2 is . it does well to protect the lens , but you ca n't put a lens cap over it . it ends up being easier to use without the lens cap...and quicker when taking pictures . the pictures are very good through it	1
this movie has the best opening scene ever ! it 's amazing how great they made this movie considering the first one was only eh.. . highly recommended	2
i purchase this instrument twice . the first time there were black specks in the lense , so it was returned . the second time was worst , i.e. same black specs but the thing did n't work at all . i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense . this is n't a quality optical product	1
this is a great lens . i do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens . it is not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 in b & h ) . this is the best value i have ever got for a lens . now i ca n't wait to get 17-40mm f4l too . you can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6 , of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject . people complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective . i like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag . i think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful	1
i love this product...it is so well worth the money if you 're experiencing a skin problem . easy to use , portable , no lotions or creams needed...just my little leather case	3
they have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut . my hair is very short and this is unusual . if you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out . i spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better . i would have been better buying a cheap pair at walmart , which i normally do	3
this simply is n't history . in real life , people do things for reasons . historians explain what happened and ( to some extent ) why . that is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts . pappe gets plenty of facts wrong , but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region . this book is propaganda masquerading as history .	0
in 1995 the poverty level for a family of four in the united states was $19 , 806. 37 million people in the us live at or below this level . ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth . in just generosity , sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america . and it is a compelling vision . sider 's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society 's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals . both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty . drawing upon biblical study , sider presents the goal of an economy of justice : " every person or family has access to productive resources ( land , money , knowledge ) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community " ( 81 ) . sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare , minimum wage , tax credits , health care , and education reform , showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work , empower the poor , and strengthen families . sider ends with this troubling question : do enough christians really care ? this book should be required reading for any that do .	0
i read these books just for fun thinking i would finish in a few days and not think about it past that . well i had another thing coming . i could n't put the book down once i had started . i missed hours of sleep because of these books . if you want a book that can keep you enraptured for hours read the artemis fowl books you wo n't regret i	0
my 2 year old loves his video . the animations are unusual but they are full of flare , color and imagination . the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter ca n't get enough of them . the main character moustache , and the rest of the characters , are all well imagined and fun . as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time , and the semi-interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line . i personally love this video and would recommend it	2
i purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was pg that it would be fine . also , the market for transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere . wow , were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie . these were not just words like shoot or dang , but the real deal . i remember transformers when i was growing up and i certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons . i am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking . who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office . concerned in alabam	2
i was so excited when i read the reviews for this intermediate level pilates tape . thought i would purchase it for variety from my ' the method ' pilates tape . i was very disappointed . the tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat . i did n't feel like i got a good tone workout . i actually wanted to fall asleep . i felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student . i give two stars because i do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but i shall be passing this on to an elderly relative	2
angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era . this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood . her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison . one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman . she focuses entirely on the black power movement . in closing , this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves	0
i bought a sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago . i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named " digital voice editor " . sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box , you had to buy a new one . only patches of the software are available to download . the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device . this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged . sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .	1
i did not like the book adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters . i also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father i shall bla bla bla	0
i am a professional photographer , and i have owned this camera for nearly two years . i also have a d70 for backup . the batteries go forever , it is very quick to respond , the images are beautiful , and it has the typical nikon durability and reliability . if you are already a nikon user , the controls will fall easily to hand . that having been said , the computer software with this camera is a joke . for the best image quality shoot raw files , color balance with a grey card , and render the images with software like capture one le . the uselessness of the included software is the only reason that this camera gets four instead of five stars . come on , nikon , be real ! ! ! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot a model for a small photo for a side bar in a catalog . i got an ugly feeling in my gut when i was told that the designer had taken a shot that was 3 / 4 figure , cropped to the head and shoulders , and enlarged the image for the cover of the 8.5 x 11 in catalog . by the time i found out , it was already at the printer . as it turned out , i was pleasantly surprised : the cover shot looked great . after that incident , i have trusted this camera and have always been pleased with the results . this camera is better than 35 mm in every way except response to the shutter button . in resolution and color reproduction it is more comparable to a medium format film camera . it is imperative to shoot raw and process the files properly to get the most out of this camera . i ca n't wait to try the d80	1
i 'm by no means an expert , but i really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price . i did a ton of research and landed on the ag-dvc30 after much agonizing over " to hd or not hd " as well as brands and features . based on all the reviews i read , this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money . i have not been disappointed . on my first outing , i took the cam to the grand canyon and sedona . wow ! what incredible color and clarity ! i also really love the 16x zoom . it 's smooth and powerful . i got great shots of the colorado river from the rim of the grand canyon . i 'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great . it is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject . if you 're interested in good audio , i 'd suggest an optional mic . if you just want great video , awesome color , and ease of use , this is your camera . at the price ( plus the rebate ) you really ca n't beat it	1
man , have i given this guy a chance . multiple chances . listened to the cds , saw the big hbo special . i mean , his career is red hot now . he clearly has lots of fans . mostly college age ( perhaps this should be a warning to some of you ) . all i can say is " maybe they 'll grow out of it . " he is not funny . his act has no bite , no point of view , no opinion / viewpoint at all . his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to ( the " this is all happened to us " or " has this ever happened to you ? " school of humor ) . he runs about manically , acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth ( for those in the audience that may not be so good with words ) . his fans acknowledge that , yes , they can relate . " yeah ! that 's happened to me ! " " i know that reference ! ' they laugh , cheer , clap , and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit . he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent , interesting way . he has no edge . he 's not outraged by anything . he 's cute ' n ' cuddly . richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic . " pryor ? the guy writing this must be old ! ' okay , try this on for size : chris rock is good comedy . same with dave chappelle . carlin . laura kightlinger . kinison . rodney dangerfield . bob saget . gilbert gottfried . dom irrera . lewis black . robert klein . the late mitch hedberg . jim norton . patton oswalt . brian posehn . degeneres . jon stewart . bob & david . the ucb . i 'm not even a big fan of sarah silverman , but at least she 's trying to bring something different to the party . anything but this ! god help us . let 's hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon ( do n't forget , cook fans , mr. top and mr. clay were once as popular as your boy here )	4
i was deeply disappointed by the so-called & quot ; return of the funk&quot ; with the headhunters reuniting with their original lineup . as compared to herbie hancock 's original & quot ; headhunters&quot ; release , the return of the headhunters is missing one main ingredient , the grease . this recent release has traded the & quot ; grits and gravy&quot ; created by the sounds of overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers , for over-produced smooth jazz-funk , complete with overused n'dea davenport r&amp ; b hooks that left this album flat	4

can we say , " money making ploy ? " wow . i , like many others , have grown up with disney . perhaps i simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs ? this is not like " kidz bop " or anything related to that which " kidifies " music - these are timeless movie classics that did not need to be redone - and as a further insult , they are poorly redone . i am very , very let down by these " disneymania " albums . :o (	4
another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson . the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones . lou even opts to ' chill ' out on a number called ' over the rainbow ' but on other numbers like ' donkey walk ' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine . the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album.keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	4

this album is not very good . i am a big fan of life in general , at the show , and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks . i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip . but i did n't care , becuase it sucked . it was boring , and it had no flavor . not the mxpx i used to know	4
i started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability . having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap , this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least , is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself , allowing full ease of rotation of the camera . though i have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of aa batteries , having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and i am in the heat of shooting . i always travel with my charge and four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the eos-20d and eos 30-d . one thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases .	1

the problem with america was that started out great . the first album was fresh and different from everything . three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own . " horse with no name " and " sandman " , was what pave the way for them . the problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop . they should of left " muskrat love . " to the captain and tennille . this album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end . the problem was that there was their first two albums , ( america and venture highway ) and there was their others . my recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans	4
many words - few practical tips ! this book did not give much more ( -valuable - ) information than i already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer . after reading the book i still had to search for web communities , where some of my questions could be answered . my expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks , contacts and appointments . unfortunately , in my view , these important and basic issues were treated too superficially .	0
this movie is my all time favorite . my friends and my sister enjoyed watching this movie and we watched it over and over .	2
clinton 's old friend and key russia advisor provides insight on a number foreign policy topics as they evolve . as deputy secretary of state , his accounts provide personal , scholarly and practical accounts . the reader might determine both that talbott was an invaluable resource as the post-cold war era evolved , and that in the end , clinton was his own & quot ; russia hand . &quot ; the primary theme of the book is the relationship between clinton and russian president boris yeltsin . as they address issues such as nato expansion , the balkans , economic difficulties , and each president 's own personal troubles , a number of lessons emerge . first , great power politics takes place between human beings , not merely among structural or organizational frameworks . second , the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex , they are not either-or options . third , political , military , economic , domestic and international issues all impact each other , often in surprising ways . fourth , watch out for the u in trying to explain policy making : in the generic y=ax+by+cz+u , that u ( for unexplained / unexpected ) can often play a large role . the russia hand is valuable to students of foreign policy , russia and u.s.-russia relations , and the emergence of the post-cold war era .	0
i loved this camera when i got it . but after three months the lens would not close . it makes grinding noises , the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again . i am very disappointed in this camera	1

not impressed at all with this product . you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it . at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved . i suggest you do n't use easyshare software . windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software . if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare . the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows	1
i 'm sure it 's a good product for beginners , but i already had an older version of quickbooks ( from 1995 ) and the only way i could export / import the old data into a newer version of quickbooks was with qb pro . simple start does n't allow you to import data from older versions	5
most people that like wes anderson 's films are rabid fanatics , and i 'm no exception , so when the chance came to buy his first feature-length film for $7 , i snapped it up . if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums , you 'll enjoy this , on some levels , too . many of anderson 's classy touches are already in evidence in this film . the story is fun , and the characters are well-developed . yeah , pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson . the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson 's character , masterfully done even in his first role .	2
i wanted to buy this for my daughter . i wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby . the outside is precious , but once you open it , the pages are like a black and white newspaper material , and they have no structure what so ever . the pages are boring and do n't look very durable	3
nikon has always been the leader in photography / camera / lenses . others have nobly tried but a nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach . when the shift from film to digital began , there was some speculation if nikon could keep up with the competition . well , rest assure that not only have they kept up , they continue to lead the way . the latest example of this is the d200. like the d70 / d80 - this is a solid piece of equipment . just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology . but the proof will always be in the end results and again , the combination of the nikon know-how and nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures . gone is the " lag between shots " . you can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours . without even " tweaking " a picture with a computer program , you can print top of the line photos at home . people have cited the cons : expensive . yes . the camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers . if you are a " vacation and holiday " picture taker , then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera . the same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons , dials and switches . there are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the " point and shoot " school of picture taking . anyone else will relish the options that nikon has provided us with on the d200. room for improvement ? well , the battery life is nowhere near as good as the d70 which i upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge . also , it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models . so if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready , this is the one for you	1
like the backstreet boys ( essentially the same band ) , and brittany spears ( their female solo artist - and i use the term loosely - equivalent ) , nsync represented all that went wrong with the music world in the ' 90's . sure , there have been completely commercial bands out there for ages , but at least groups like the eagles wrote their own material and played their own instruments . not nsync , who instead rely on unimaginably boring backing tracks and a stable of professional songwriters who could n't write a decent tune to save their lives - i bet even their voices were digitally altered . and then there were the inescapable hits - bye bye bye , pop , it 's gonna be me , tearin ' up my heart , et al . , that were n't even good the first time around , to say nothing of the nine trillionth . no risks taken . no attempts to step out of their winning formula that somehow made this group of no-talents famous . basically , this band was thrown together by a bunch of record company chumps who saw five or six guys who wanted to be famous ( and probably had never previously met ) , sent them through the assembly line , removed any sense of individuallity or creativity they might 've had , and dumped them upon the masses , who they must 've brainwashed or something . i did n't even like this group when i was 10 , to say nothing of now . makes you wish zappa was still alive - he 'd have a field day with a group like this , and undoubtedly dish out some of the funniest insults ever in the process .	4
i was optimistic when i saw the title , but you know that old saying , " do n't judge a book by its cover . " the author has a few legitimate ideas , but any google search could come up with the same information in greater depth and better accuracy . she condemns saving animals from shelters and actually encourages people to breed animals to increase the pet population . she is no more a pet lover than i am a supermodel . her ideas are based solely on money . even if it encourages starting a puppy mill ( euphemistically referred to as a dog breeder ) . early in her book she mentions the titles of a few other books she recommends ( i have chosen not to seek them out ) , but she says do n't spend your money on them , just go to the library and check them out . if you insist on reading this book i give you the same advice . do not buy this book- -check it out from your local library ! then do google searches to get more in-depth , accurate information about any of the four decent ideas she did have , or come back to amazon.com and find a more specific book that can actually be of use . oh , and by the way , the world is already overpopulated with unwanted pets . encouraging people to add to the problem is morally reprehensible	0

here is the short version . oct05 i bought a fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera for $299.99. nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots have alternating bright / dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent the camera in to fujifilm 's service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a ~$300 camera should work for more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 the service center sent me a repair estimate for $70.00 + tax and shipping totaling $85.95 ( i spent $16.52 to send it to them so my total expense would have been $102.47 for the repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse . and that i do n't think that it makes sense for me to pay $100 to repair a $300 camera that stopped working only 1 month after the warranty expired . the service rep , named christina , asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate . now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera , its memory card , and the shipping i paid .	1

yep , we love this camera ! amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to las vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip . the still shots are amazing , you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't . in fact we tested this and have proof , as we had both cameras with us . my son got a great close up of star jones from far across the gathered crowd , right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her , and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you ca n't even tell what the subject was ! i love that we have two cameras in one , video and stills , so we do n't have to carry both . i really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power does n't threaten to wipe the memory clean . we eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip . it would be nice to have a separate battery charger , but it really did n't get inconvenient , we 'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up . and the price was excellent for all the features we got . yep , we love this camera	1

you ca n't beat the hd picture quality from the hv20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models . while this is a single cmos sensor , it is a true 1920 x 1080 hd sensor of the same quality found in the award winning canon digital slr cameras . do n't be fooled by a 3ccd camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use " pixel shifting " . i had already hooked up the hv20 to my 720p projector , and it did look great even at my typical 120 " . but i do know that my projector probably is n't calibrated very well to be honest . so , my first wow moment came when i decided to capture some of my best outdoor footage from my canon elura stock and compare it to some hv20 footage shot of my kids over the weekend at an easter egg hunt . wow , the difference in quality was even more pronounced than i realized . i guess that the resolution difference is what it is , but this is definitely serious hd quality . the real defining wow moment that has me " selling " all of my family and friends on this camcorder came last night when i hooked it up at my brother-in-law 's house to his sony wega crt hdtv display that does 1080i and is calibrated to perfection . you wo n't find a higher quality hd display than his set imo , and my jaw dropped when my video first came up on his display that was the first time when i was truly able to see what my source footage was capable of in terms of its full resolution and amazing colors . we switched to discovery hd on his set , and other than obvious production value aspects you honestly could n't really say that it looked any more hd than the footage of my kids playing . this is way more exciting to me than when i first saw broadcast hd and watched monday night football because it is hard to describe how cool it is to see your kids on video in beautiful hd for a $1 , 000 price point . i can hardly wait to get out there and shoot some more footage .	1
i 've just returned this unit . it does n't play videos as advertised . i was able to get it to properly play .avi files at 320 x 240 resolution...see other review below . but 320x240 gives a postage stamp size picture . at 640 x 480 the playback was full size but jerky and broken....more later . i have now had 3 different brands of 8 " photo frames in my possession : a phillips , a pandigital , and this coby . i have developed the following list of features in my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i 've been taking a lot of video clips with my digital still camera...they come out well and the convenience of not having to lug my camcorder along , and the ability to quickly transfer clip files within / between chips and my computer is attractive . i would like a frame which will play the format my camera is taking ( .mov , more later ) i 'd also like the frame to play a multi-media show...that is , to play movie clips in show presentations , intermixed with .jpg photo files . second feature is to play .wma music files , in addition to mp3. this is because i have a non-ipod personal music player . all my music is in .wma format because it is roughly half the file size of mp3. third , i would like a timer on my frame...set it to come on in the morning , off at night , for example . fourth , i 'd like an audio or speaker out feature . none of these frames has home theater-like sound , and i have an extra pair of computer speakers i 'd probably hook up . video out could come in handy too . fifth , i 'd like to be able to rotate stills from within the frame 's software , manually or automatically . yes , you can rotate them in the computer , but the frame may or may not preserve the rotation . ( this may depend on which photo edit program you are using . ) sixth , i 'd like a folder hierarchy file management system in the frame 's software . especially with the huge chips now available , i see an advantage to push a couple of buttons and change the picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here is where the 3 units i 've had stack up , followed by my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping the pandigital....which costco has for $140. it plays .mov video files , but not within a slideshow . it has no speaker out jack and the sound is tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock / timer . no ability to play stills / video intermixed . i think the coby and phillips picture quality is brighter but the pandigital is ok . the phillips did n't play video , and since it also had a software glitch when i returned it i decided to look elsewhere . ( no remote and no music with the philips either . ) the coby wo n't play my videos , even after i used my converter program to try about 10 different mp4 and avi variations . the coby plays .wma music files , wo n't rotate stills , has no folder system , no clock / timer . it has a speaker out jack . it does not permit intermixing video and stills in one multimedia show . picture quality is fully equal to philips , generally the recognized standard . if all you want is photos , and never turn your camera sideways , this unit will be a good value . another unit i 'd like to get to play with would be the image moments model by digitalfoci . i 've exchanged emails with someone there who clearly knows what they are talking about and i believe this unit will intermix my photos and videos .	1
" the great locomotive chase " is the stuff of legend . this somewhat obscure event , which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter , could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark , a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days , to second manassas , to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union . but first-time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms , telling it well , and placing it in its proper context . the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue , espionage , and derring-do . and if mr. bonds had only told the tale itself , this book would be well worth the read . but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr. bonds 's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively , while putting it in its proper context . the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas . and by doing so , and by explaining why the raid , coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama , offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war , mr. bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï¿½lan of the raiders its proper place . andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark , even though students of the era will have the natural reaction , " what were they thinking ? " mr. bonds answers that question , and the answer , as incongruous as it may seem , reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia . if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid , reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished , this would be a wonderful adventure story , in the great tradition of shelby foote 's narrative history of the war . but this book does so much more . it puts the raid in its proper strategic context , and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed . this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well-told .	0

hacker 's challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the hacking exposed series . hacker 's challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing . hacker 's challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response . the style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down . its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies . it may not affect the quality of the book overall , but i preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in hacker 's challenge . however , you should definitely buy this book !

polanyi sets forth an incredibly relevant , radical , and all too plausible theory in this book . going beyond a mere analysis of how the market system functions , polanyi endeavors to answer the question as to how the market came about . polanyi 's answer will not be pleasing to libertarians , he argues that a free land and labor market can only come about through government intervention , and must be sustained through further intervention . he also argues that the market ransforms the nature of social relations . usually , economic relations were a result of social relations , under the market , it is the latter . polanyi attempts to show how a market for land and labor came about in britain . his argument that government " enclosures " created it through dislodging the poor and turning their land into sources of economic production is convincing . however , other arguments polanyi advances simply demonstrate a central government repealing the interventions of subaltern governments . polanyi 's argument that there was no " rent-seeking " ( he does n't use that term ) involved in the enactment of state intervion in the economy ( " proving " that this intervention was objectively necessary is suspect . one 19th century investigators conclusions do n't serve to overturn the implications of public choice theory . the greatest problem with this book is that polanyi does n't do too much to back up his arguments . he fortunately has a section called " notes and sources " where he lists his research material , but i 'd wager that most of this is difficult to find 60 years later	0
the transformers gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's . it pains me to say this for i am a fan of the series . it was a travesty to see optimus prime ( the greatest of the transformers ) fall in battle and pass on the matrix of leadership to a successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable of leadership . galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of megatron- -he lacked the malevolent cunning of megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic . why would a decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? as for the new generations of autobots and decepticons introduced in the movie , they were forgettable . it amuses me that " fans " are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago . the transformers failed at the box office and i am glad it did . as a fan , i was insulted . perhaps these other " fans " have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage .	2
i tried all the possible creams on the market , cheap and expensive , for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately . i cannot live without it , this is a keeper . it stings a little bit , not all the time but it does . it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i 've had a really tiring week and i 'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day , just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them . i guarantee that in three days you 'll not recognize yourself ( in a good way ) . very important : it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream ( i use pure chamomile cream ) and leave it over night . well , follow my recipe and you 'll shine fast , you 'll see	3
this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens . it covers the useful 18-35 mm range ( which is 27-52mm on a nikon digital slr , which is a very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half the price of the ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , and does almost as nice a job . sufficiently nice , in fact , that most amateurs will not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like a tank , i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent , and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros . on a nikon digital slr , which will use the center portion of this lens ( due to the size of the sensor in the slr ) you can expect excellent , even spectacular results . this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent , versatile lens . this one is great for parties , vacations , and the works . the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast , are very sharp , and have beautiful color rendition . there just is not a lot not to like about this lens . i give it 4 stars for overall performance , but 5 stars for value and price / performance . some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers . this is one of those	1
while " talk to the hand " is inescapably mediocre in comparison to " eats , shoots & leaves " , a book i found amusing , though not up-to-par to its new york times bestseller status , this book does have its moments . however , i was uterrly bloody appalled at the rudeness of lynne truss in presuming to make a comment that , despite whatever way she meant it , ended up sounding like she thought gluten intolerance was a choice . i find it interesting that she , or at least her editors , did not further investigate the disease ( which , indeed , gluten tolerance is ) before publishing such a degrading remark . oh , yes , bloody well sorry , ms. truss , for invading your rude , stay-home-and-bolt-the-door causitive world with yet another irritation which , i 'm sure , someone created just so you would have to sit in a restaurant and listen to someone else get special treatment for a fad diet . let 's just go and , well , obliterate a genetic disorder ! while we 're at it , we might as well just make the lactose intolerant drink milk . if it pleases and thanks you , ms. truss , we celiacs will eat cake . ( oh , bloody hell , did i just say " please " ? ) despite the fact that lynne truss makes this world out to be such a horribly rude place , i have to wonder if she 's experiencing the effects of projection . in explaining how rude we humans are , it was necessary for her to be quite rude , as well . it is not simply the celiac remark to which i refer : i also found her supermarket incident , in which a kid shouts at his mother , " i want that one , you effing bitch ! " , among others , a bit offensive . as a member of both the gluten intolerant community and the younger generation so responsible for this rudeness , i was often thoroughly appalled by this book . no , my friends and i do n't usually hold doors for each other , but , in general , i thank and get thanked in return for a money lend or a coffee downtown . frankly , i find myself more often in the perpetual motion of manners with my friends , as well as strangers , than in a cycle of rudeness which includes swearing for the sake of swearing and no regard for others . i can safely say that all of my friends ignore their cell phones if we are having a conversation , or , if they must answer , they apologize profusely before going outside to talk so they do not offend the people around them . i have to argue that we are not a select group . in today 's world , one sees what one expects to see ; one is treated as one expects to be treated . ms. truss , i believe , would find that perahps if she simply lowered her expectations slightly and gave out all the respect she possibly could , she would be surprised to find that , when people are rude , she cares less because she knows that she , at least , is doing her best not to be . if she did this , maybe she would be less likely to jump all over people who are rude because she would not be so worried about her own behavior . my last complaint is this : " gluten crap " ? you would think that such a sophisticated , eloquent ( as she is dedicated to proving ) person as lynne truss would have been able to find a better word to describe gluten than the third-year , am-i-not-so-cool-and-bitchin ' ( ? ) style word " crap .	0
sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author . when the author is in error about that subject , the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book . such is the case here . i 've written 123 books ; several on parachutes and skydiving . i am a pilot , skydiver and parachute rigger ; i know the sport and the industry . the author wrote : " we use flat chutes as parasails .

i really like omniform 5. actually i 'm using version 5.1 and i 'm very satisfied with it . i was using another forms program i had purchased that was adequate but not nearly as good . after using formtool i have a much greater appreciation of omniform . scansoft has been on my list of not to buy software recently because of some of the poor performance of some of their other programs , tech support is expensive from scansoft and none of their software that i have used have been easy to learn using the manuals or help files . in contrast omniform was well worth the money . omniform 5 does a great job of either creating forms from scratch , scanning or converting from pdf . it 's the only forms program i have tried so far that actually does a great job of importing a form from a pdf file . its has all the tools you need to create a form starting with a blank page . you can define any field with a variety of formats . example you can create a date field with a specific format then no matter how the data is input the program will automatically reformat the data the way you specified . you can create just about any field simply by dragging a symbol from a menu onto the page . in the case of inserting a graphic you can choose to have the graphic saved with the form or not saving with the form itself to conserve file size . you can have the graphic resized by the program with little loss of quality . features such as these might be available in other programs of this type but i found omniform to do the best job with creating a form field by field with the least effort . scanning in of a form is almost flawless . it even recognized fields on the paper form that were meant to be circled and created the field for them . other programs i have used could not do this well if at all . the only adjustments i had to make on scanned forms were sometimes omniform recognized text as bold when it was n't and occasionally it would change the font . for example it would change arial to times new roman on some spots of the form . strange quirk . to get a form imported from a pdf file you have to open the pdf file and print to omniform . this is very accurate with little adjustment necessary after import . omniform really shines in this area . but i did notice if the form your importing from pdf has multiple pages omniform will give you an out of memory error when you try to save . to overcome this flaw you have to import one page at a time , creating a new page each time in omniform to make a multi page form from pdf . a little time consuming when you have a 9 page form . it will create a self running .exe form you can e-mail and the person on the other end can fill out the form and send it back . this works even the other person does not have omniform on their machine . because some people filter out .exe file attachments the program also creates a .html version of the form . this is a very handy feature . the help file is not of much use . the paper manual is better but still lacking . if you have problems tech support from scansoft is expensive . but there is a user support forum you can get to through the support page on the scansoft web site . i have used the forum with great success . overall this program is a little difficult to use with some quirks and needed features like being able to import and save a multiple page form from pdf . but well worth the effort to use as it is the most accurate forms program i have used . i do recommend this program . if the flaws i mentioned were corrected i would give this program 5 stars	5
okay , take everything that you know about john squire . strip away the amazing stone roses first album , the not so amazing follow up , the nice brit pop of his work with the seahorses and picture this as a solo album from a new artist and i honestly think that peoples thoughts on this album would change drastically . they would realize that every track on it is a winner and that the guitar work is amazing and beautiful , the vocals might be grating at first ( think robert forster ( the go-betweens ) circa before hollywood ) but that upon repeated listens grows on you and you eventually end up loving . what you expect going into an album has alot to do with how much you like or dislike it and this album is no exception . people should listen to it for what it is and not for what john squire was...john squire is an established song writer who has moved beyond what he used to do ( who has n't moved on in 13 years ? minus robert smith of course ! ) and now writes beautiful pop songs...john squire has grown up just like his original audience has and this solo album is the perfect proof of that	4
well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately : the female teenage protagonist ( played by witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here ) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant . at one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one-gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling . later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , bella abzug-style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust . clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men . of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter- -ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course . in this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal- -but that 's why they call them movies . when are these post-modern writers , artists , and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural- -men simply do not prefer masculine females . men want someone to complement them , not compete with them . men crave femininity in females , not feminism . wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit : by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut , if that is even a step upward . but the plucky gal- -she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations . uh , another problem with this movie- -and there are many- -is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert , something which should be , and for a time is here depicted as , a foreboding and life-threatening task . yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ; and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out-of-place manner , considering the dire situation they are in . the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light-hearted , inane scenes . look , i dig disney kid movies- -more realistic ones . you know , old style disney movies . you take " old yeller " for example . now there was a quality kid movie , and quite true to life . this movie was not . it had a plastic , spoiled-american-materialistic-teenybopper feel throughout . disney has gone down the tubes . in any number of ways , they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas ( note : one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion- -something called " tapping , " while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un-pc judeo-christian religion- -this is bias , folks , leftwing , pc bias , same as the aforementioned feminist bilge ) . i am learning to run , not walk , away from disney stuff , and this movie was further cause for me to do so .	2
this software will not load properly no matter how you try . the online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install . their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that i needed buy the components that did n't load but were on the disk . try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly . mcafee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked . need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you 're first call . i have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a " reputable " company in a long time . i will never buy mcafee products again .	5

i read about lila downs ' new cd , la cantina , in victor cruz - lugo 's article entitled , " sweet sorrow , " published in the june-july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine ( page 76 ) . it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs ' new cd , la cantina : 1. the cd cover is awesome , a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock . it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time , awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song . 2. each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila 's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family . 3. i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera 's legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000. juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice . later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i 've been a fan of her work ever since . 4. this new cd is indeed a delightful experience . i appreciate that she moved into the corrido , son , etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more . it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious . it 's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity . i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila 's work . she is a true artist . i 've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds , however , this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience . 5. i am very impressed with lila 's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000. there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon . ahua ! her solos in " yo ya me voy , " have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity . as victor cruz-lugo writes , " through it all , downs ' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart , tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same . " this is my favorite of lila 's repertoire . it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed . enjoy !	4
i really like this curling iron.. . - and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! it heats up very quickly , and gives me great curls . the key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair . then , after you curl , make sure to take a blowdryer on cold / low setting to lock the curls down . i always receive so many compliments on my hair ! !	3
the title says it all , im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time :	4
this is a complex and detailed history chiefly of cuban exiles in south florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various u.s. administrations . in that sense , it is the story of two cities - miami and washington - and two peoples - americans and cubans . i have an objection , though , with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously , even gorgeously at times , written . didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and , worse , the result is a cold , humorless , colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup . the author , in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose , apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers . it is , in that sense , a boring little disaster of a book .	0
to customer before me , you camera d200 might be on recall . please check the nikon website for more info . you have described the exact recall problem . good luck ! btw , have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 ? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200.	1
like many amazon reviewers , i play a teensy bit of guitar . i know just enough to know how incredible these guys are . this is the best , most exciting acoustic playing i 've heard since al dimeola cut " race with devil on spanish highway " on his elegant gypsy suite lp . watching the del castillo brothers shred on the dvd part of this set will assure that i do n't get anywhere near my guitar for a long time . since robert rodriguez ( desperado , spy kids , etc ) filmed the performances , we get appallingly good , tight shots of the fretwork . people , it ca n't be done . i will henceforth concentrate on harmonica , and try to forget that sugar blue does about the same level of impossibility on that instrument . the songs and playing come from a somewhat traditional latin , mexicano perspective , but the overall sound is more like santana when carlos goes acoustic . the " hidden track " on the cd most overtly shows that the del castillo brothers love their blues and rock almost as much as the latin roots music . this is an obvious buy for anyone who enjoys latin music or great guitar work of any style , but it is more accurate to say that anyone who is not totally averse to this style should check it out . the quality of music here really transcends the genre	4
i bought this after using the inexpensive wahls for years . i love it for several reasons : 1 ) it cuts without pulling on your whiskers 2 ) it is very precise 3 ) it picks up 90% or more of your whiskers 4 ) not only do you not have the hair in the sink , but you no longer feel like it will take a shower to get all of the excess hair out of your beard , if there is any to speak of 5 ) unlike others , i did not feel the need to have a more precision tool to trim my mustache . it worked just fin	3
this works best for me . i do n't like a wet or greasy look . this holds well , then dries as if nothing is on the hair . without it , my hair falls down into my eyes . i think it 's the best	3
my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie . he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending . he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie , with a young michael j . fox in it , and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie	2
not exactly the " vaults " blowing open , as stated in the promo . these are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s , when the group was on hiatus from serious recording . that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows , literary journals and graphic design firms . whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected , such as " reprehensible " , " rest awhile " and " certain people i could name " . but there are too few of these real songs , and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career	4
i had access to the cd version of this product that came with the image library catalog in the box . i liked using it and although there was a lot of cd disc-trading with 34 discs , it worked well for me . i could usually go to the disc i wanted on the first attempt . later , i wanted to add this collection to my home office and went back to the same store where the original version was bought . they had sent back all the cd editions where the image catalog was included in the box and replaced them with the dvd edition that is only 5 discs and you have to send off for the catalog for the low low price of shipping ( $4.95 ) . whenever i go to use the dvd 's , i have to wait a long time for the dics to load into memory and almost forever if i request the thumbnail versions to come up in the browser . i would rather switch discs any day then spend my time staring at the monitor while waiting for the computer to load my information . the store involved is happy because they are using less box space on the shelf ( or so the stock personnel said ) . i am unhappy at having to send off for the manual that says it 's included on the box but is n't , the extra money for the shipping , and the awkwardness to use this ' upgraded ' product	5
photos printed are very sharp . some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are , you ca n't afford to have much difficulty . good for craft times with the kids	1
i am finding that it is not so diffucult to navigate my way around the new programs of excel , word etc. opening up files - it tends to be a bit sluggish . on the plus side i found word 2007 seems to do a much better job of lining up indents . in word 2003 our indents were sometimes off by a half space which bothered us .	5
great camera , only bad thing are the batteries die very quickly it takes great pictures and has some good features. .	1
we are in the last part of the 19th century in this novel , and the wild west has breathed its last . the book is peopled with real legends ( calamity jane , buffalo bill , sitting bull ) and fictional curiosities ( jim ragg and bartle bone - two mountain men , and no ears - an indian with exceptional eyesight ) . mcmurtry relates a sad , elegiac farewell to times past . the ever-interesting characters and their views of the world , which are wise and funny and fascinating , make the novel top-notch in the mcmurtry canon	0
i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best . i had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews , and i got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways . ( of course , it costs a lot more ) . recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100% good photos , with several really outstanding ones . it is light , accurate and has is - what more do you want ? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it . bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment . if you have one lens , this is the one	1
i eat one of these twice a week before i play ice hockey . i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine , though i do n't perceive any " boost " . it could be there and i 'm just not noticing it . i feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout . it would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the clif bar . i find the size of a clif bar a bit disappointing , especially considering the " store " price of $1.50. at $11 a case and with free shipping when spending $25 or more , i 've not found a better price than amazon 's on clif bars	3
i bought this iron for my teen daughters - actually i bought it twice , since i did n't have much choice where i was shopping . both times it died . the first iron lasted about 6 months , and the second lasted 2 weeks ! just dies , no warning . my girls are begging me to buy them a decent straightener that is not a conair ! i am going to invest in a better one this time and am doing a lot of research	3
this is n't a product thats going to get you laid after she sniffs it a couple of times . it 's starts the chat and dialog . what it does do is start the conversation and keep you the their target . m-11 kicks up the yackity yak in her with you being the focus . i ; ve tried a few of them including that 90 dollar rip off thats advertised in popular science , and this is product works just fine . give it a go guys . it gets you past that awkward dork moment when you are trying to talk about somthing other that what starbucks you hang at . its not a sex pill so forget it . but , it will open up the road you need to walk down to get to the garden of eden or whatever . so do n't be a little whimp . be a man and give it a go . its a way to the women you want via the mental route . yes , you have to think . it will work for you so do it	3
i 've owned this software since it 's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception . even at it 's latest 1.5.1 $299 version apple should still be ashamed of themselves . i use final cut studio and own 3 recent macs , so i 've been devoted to apple to say the least . i am a professional wedding photographer / videographer . i have been more than patient with this software . it looks great , up to apple 's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs . and unless you pay apple laughable amounts of money ( much more than the cost of the software itself ! ) , they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue . as someone who has been such an apple fan , i feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and download lightroom from adobe .	5
after user #1 i was really impressed . my teeth were noticeably whiter- -almost gleaming . after use number two i noticed a bit more whitening but not as dramatic . on use # 3 i felt some discomfort after putting the trays in . after about 1 / 2 hour it was really starting to hurt and i thought something must be wrong so i took them out . my gums were bleached white ! i was really freaked out by this but for the most part it did subside after about 1 / 2 an hour . however , there was some lingering damage done that , while not severe , is annoying ( there is still a slight bit of bleeding ) . i have perfectly healthy gums so i was surprised by this...the third tray did some fairly serious damage to otherwise healthy gums . my advice , if it hurts at all that is not normal and you should take them out	3
since buying the upgrade of windows xp i have had to reinstall it 3 times -onto a clean hard disk - the first time it just disappeared and turned into a blue screen , with messages that hive files were gone missing ? 2nd time round the registery got corrupted and the last time it refused to boot , and not wanting to have to trall through another install i used the xp cd to try the recovery consol . this was as much use as a cigarette lighter on a motor bike . none of the commands worked , and even trying the help file was useless . there seems to be a serious problem with system restore in xp , and im fully updated with all the latest spacks , and stacks of space on my hard disk alotted to sr ! check dates will disappear and when you really need st to get you back and running -it goes pear shaped ! i now running 3 restored version of xp completly backed up on a seperate hard disk using power quests drive image . my experences with xp are its not reliable. .	5
i love this rangefinder - much better than the type that shoots the prism on the flag sticks . you can use this one to find yardage to bunkers , creeks , etc. very accurate and very useful . well worth the money	1
dr. temperance brennan , a forensic anthropologist , is called upon to aid in the investigation of a commercial jet crash in the mountains of north carolina . andrew ryan , a colleague and romantic possible , turns up on site also when his partner in the quebec police is listed on the flight manifest . when temperance discovers a foot that does not seem to come from the disaster site , things begin to get dangerous for her and those around her . it becomes a clue in a deadly mystery involving many highly placed individuals who want their secret to remain just that , a secret . temperance and ryan spark reactions from each other , the question is , will it ignite or just smolder ? ? this novel is full of forensic science and detail that open the door to a fascinating yet gruesome world . kathy reichs has an afterword page in which she talks about 9 / 11 and the real disaster site in nyc where she aided in determining the identities of victims from the twin towers , serving on the government disaster response team , much like temperance in this novel.......although she says the horror and emotional impact was more than she could have imagined . the novel was written and published 2 months before the real disaster occurred	0
this is worthless and they say it 's refundable , until you read the fine print and realize it 's only if you bought the entire product line . it is crap and does n't do anything . do n't waste your money , drink milk and your hair will grow . this does not work	3

this digital photo frame has reasonably good picture quality and once set up , can be used by anyone in the selected mode . i have it set for slide presentation mode and people enjoy looking at it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , to people who are not computer savvy , such as grandparents . to give them new pictures , send a new card and they slip that in . that said , the cost is still fairly high and the buttons on the top of the frame useless unless you have them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product	1
ordered two frames from the third party source . neither on of them worked at all . it has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund	1
i keep this frame on all day and night . the lcd backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out . the quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res . is not good if viewing up close . there is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag . regular lcd backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night . this one just lasted 4 months . so the image is almost non-existant now . in the glare , you can barely make out the image so it 's still there but with no backlight so good as dead . i would recommend a more expensive philips ones . my friend has had it for about two years and it 's still going . plus it 's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips , which this one ca n't	1
this album contains only rap and no rock songs . this was very disappointing to say the least	4
i love mr. koontz and have long read his novels...watchers , intensity , odd thomas and so on but this was dissappointing , not to mention just plain depressing . and come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters ! okay okay , we know the 9 year - old leilani has a high iq but really ! she speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence ? these characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into . therefore , i put it down after 350 pages of this twattle . koontz has done much better in the past . lastly , let 's keep dogs out of your next few novels , please ? it 's getting a bit old . how about a smart cat or raven for your next novel , maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do ?	0

i was excited to try these because i liked the idea of getting my son something that let him put his legs together . i am tired of seeing him so bowlegged due to the diapers . and since i like the other huggies styles , i was very enthused . until i went through 5 diapers , everyone of which leaked . leaking of urine was the biggest problem but after a bm came out the legs , i gave up . i tried everything possible to make these work , but they leak . maybe in the smaller sizes , but size 5 on a 22 month old definitely did not work . also , my son is in 50% percentile for height and weight , so skinny legs were not the problem . no more natural fit / hugflex for us	3
$10 bucks and does the job . you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do .	3
we have not received this item yet . please let me know the current status	1
i have used this software for about 4 weeks since posting my comment in reply to that review . having now had a chance to use the software , i can only say that i am almost 100% satisfied with it . some times , it 's nice to have a spanish dictionary when after a few lessons , you still ca n't quite grasp the concept of the word you 're being taught , but other than that.. . yes , it is repetitious . for those who want to learn another language , this is to be expected . no , it 's not a magic pill . however , in as little as three weeks i found myself largely able to understand what native speakers around me were talking about , even if my understanding of it was imperfect . repetition ( as they say ) is key , but even if it were not , dedication is absolutely required . you can only learn if you stick with the program , and even i have been rather lax about that much . still , i am wholly satisfied with my purchase . it is clear to me that the program is only as good as its user though , and i really ought to be more dedicated to following it	5
i took it straight out of the package , plugged it in for a charge . charger never reached " green " ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later . customer service was not the best i 've had . do n't make the same mistake , keep looking	1
this is kl 's reveiw this was a very good movie but the plot was a little on the strange side . mitchel musso did a great job , well we all know he always does a great job.okay i 'll stop drooling over him and get back to the movie . this movie is about a cranky old man that dos n't like people to set one foot on his lawn , and a teenage boy that lives across the street that documents every toy the old man takes because it touched his lawn , what time it was when it accured , and takes pictures.but then when a tragic incident happens to the old man and every one asumes him dead well at least the boys do . the teenager dj and his friend chouder discover that the house is even stranger than the old man and that the house seems to be possessed by the old man , well thats what the boys think . then when a arogant girl named jenny selling holloween candy goes up to the house dj and chouder come to her rescue and she ends up helping them find out more about the house . their plan is to put out the fire or the heart of the house . but when thay finally get inside of the house they discover a very strange thing which i 'm not going to say because your going to have to just watch it for your self.but before they get to the heart , they get up chucked , lol.and then a horrable thing comes to their minds its holloween and every kid that goes to that house is going to get eaten ! but i 'm geting too close to the ending or am i ? well if you have n't seen it you would n't know so you 'll just have to watch it because i 'm not giving any more of the movie away ! hope you like it and by the way mitchel musso 's mine ! ! ! ! !	2
i bought this camera in about february 2005 but did n't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot . takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture . i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface ( loose dirt and sawdust ) and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on . contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one . so i am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp	1
first of all i am in my early 20 's so i have n't much experience in night creams . i just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after i decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness . i use " moisture therapy cream " by olay in the morning before i put on my makeup , and then i use this at night . my skin always feels so soft , more soft than i think it ever did . i ca n't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability , but i can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier . the scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to . i would recommend this product to anyone of any age . it has a good price compared to everything else on the market and i believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun . prevention is key	3
cruel , horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot . the abuse of children , evil ranger poising as a dead ranger , freaky religious sect , dead animals on the bed , and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me . i 've read many barr books , and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters , it 's hard to keep them straight . in this book , that was the last of my worries . i did n't even finish it , i was so turned off	0
overproduction and heavy use of repetitive " special " effects ( such as rothbart 's enlarged and projected image " flying " over the heads of siegfried and odette ) make this version of swan lake funny . anorexia " survivor " evelyn hart 's role as odette / odile makes watching the video painful . she is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing : i was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second . not worth the money , in my opinion	2
without words.. . been waiting my whole life to get this picture ; it can take you from laughing ur heart out to burst into tears ; no comments coz i 'll ruin it but it 's simply a wonderfull movie	2
there are two thing that i do n't like about this set . the curlers get too hot to handle and the lid is n't attached to the base which is very inconvenient . i would n't recommend them	3
easy to use ; and a wicked incentive to lose weight . have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking .	3
i give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer . this movie is not bram stoker 's dracula , but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story . if it was named something else or even kept the name dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name i 'd give it 5 stars . if you want to see the real dracula story first read the actual book by bram stoker , then watch the silent film nosferatu . nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right . dracula is a monster , he 's not a star crossed lover at all and was n't intended to be . people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply is n't one . it 's a horror tale , not a vieled porn book , and certainly not a love story . if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him	2

this is the most god awful method for learning a language i have ever encountered . my jaw dropped when i saw that nasa and other government agencies were using this software in order to learn a foreign language . if that is truly the case then i demand my tax dollars back . it is that bad . the reason i gave this software a shot is because their marketing campaign has been asserting that it was the absolute definitive method for learning a new language . you 're probably looking at it for the same reason . first , you should know that you can purchase a set of flash cards from your local bookstore and it is just as effective as any rosetta stone softare and costs 90% less . i used this software when i borrowed it from a friend in order to see if it was better than my current method of learning mandarin , which i 'll get into later . i had an opportunity to make copies of this software when it was in my possession but decided against it . not out of fear of piracy penalties , just plain because i would rather not have this software than have a copy of it . that 's really how awful it is . imagine if your parents tried to teach you english by only teaching you noun / picture association ? it would n't work unless you learned about proper english grammar and proper syntax . if you learned about verbs and other things . this program will assume you know all your chinese numbers automatically . in the very beginning a picture of a little girl will show up and it will verbally say ' one little girl ' in mandarin.. . however it will not tell you which word means the number one , which word means girl , and so on . it 's a guessing game , not a learning experience . all the positive reviews i 've seen for any rosetta stone software on amazing seem absolutely phony and fabricated to me ( especially on the rosetta stone japanese page ) . please beware , and there is no better way to prove that what i 'm saying is true other than trying a demo for yourself . i am sure that it is as bad as the full retail version that i used for a week . the absolute best method i 've used for learning mandarin has been pimsleur 's audio cds . ( i 've never tried berlitz and pimsleur 's other competitors , but i 'm sure they are better than rosetta stone ) . i have used mandarin i and ii so far from pimsleur , and i am able to hold impressive conversations with other fluent speakers of mandarin . the great thing about it is that pimsleur explains everything to you , allows you to say it out loud , there is no brute memorization involved with pimsleur , only natural language assimilation . just ask yourself this , when you learned english as a child . did you learn by learning how to read and write first ? or did you learn how to speak and listen first ? did n't you learn syntax first and then use what you learned to formulate your own sentences ? that 's exactly how pimsleur has taught me mandarin . i was surprised how i was able to create my own grammatically correct sentences with pimsleur only a few lessons in . go ahead and try a demo of any rosetta stone language . it should be enough to keep you away from rosetta stone in favor of any of their competitors . i 've heard good things about berlitz and others , but pimsleur in my opinion is the absolute best .	5
compared to the conair 1 , 600w i have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high-pitched when i first turned it on , but you may have a high-pitched blow dryer now- -compared to my old conair- -and wo n't notice a difference . it does n't have a cold air feature , which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair ; or like me , in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable . these two drawbacks , especially having only the hot at high or low setting , is why i give it four out of five , instead of five out of five star rating . pluses : price- -for $13 it ca n't be beat for the frugal shopper ; efficiency- -it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the conair did though i do n't understand the science behind that ; appearance- -it 's cute and compact ; weight- -a toddler could wield this blow-dryer with ease ; carrying ease- -small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag , under the sink , et cetera . i have n't had this long enough to rate how durable it is , so i hope someone who 's owned one for at least a year comes on to write , " it 's still going strong .	3
i 've found the recipes here generally simple and easy to make ahead . mrs. burros is very clear in her instructions ( although i had some problems with a chocolate roll ) and the taste combinations are very good . as this book is an update of her original there are a number of amusing asides on changes in food ingredients and cooking styles between the two editions . not quite a & quot ; must-have&quot ; but useful	0
these shows do n't date . they are as fresh as they were over 30 years ago . these shows deserved all the emmys they received . a must-see series . i 'm glad they are finally releasing them . i would prefer more extra features though . more show commentary would be nice as well	2
for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars . if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe . i too around 5000 photos . i posted a few on the web ( see link below ) . for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens . the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and ( almost ) very sharp . get this lens instead of the kit lens ( 18-55 mm ) until you are ready to spend more . here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens ( images have been compressed ) : http : / / www.laplazita.net / europa /	1
i used to have an canon elura 70 , which was an excellent camcorder but the firewire transfer did n't work so i decided to replace it with the elura 100 only to find that canon had discontinued the elura line . i really wanted an elura for the improved video quality over the low-end zr models . so as a compromise i purchased the zr 850 which has a 1mp ccd , not a good as the elura ( 1.3mp ) but better than the other zr 's ( .640mp ) . the video quality was n't bad but the motor noise was so loud i could n't believe it . i returned the first one but the replacement was just as bad . this is n't a minor hum in the background i 'm talking about , its a full-on whine ! i also found the zr camera to be difficult to handle with my small-ish hands and the video stabilisation was a bit disappointing . luckily i could return both cameras without incurring a restocking fee and found a reconditioned elura 100 that is much more satisfactory . its a mystery to me how canon can produce two markedly different cameras ( quality wise ) in the same price range and opt to phase out the better one	1
3rd force 's new cd & quot ; force field&quot ; is their first new cd in a few years . the track & quot ; revelation of the heart&quot ; sets the tone for this wonderful recording . a must have to add to your collection	4
when i tried this program out , i at first had some trouble running it . but then i went to the website at : www.kutoka.com and click on the support tab and then select easyspeak spanish . they give you a link for the version of flash 8 you need to run . after this everything worked well . while some may have been offended by bathing suits . not me and not my kids . there is absolutly nothing obscene here folks . this program is the best thing going for learning spanish quickly ! and it is fun to use with the many games and puzzles that you work out with real life scenerios . very artistic and fun . you can go to the bank , the hospital , and several different places , learn a new set of words and situations . that you could really use in a foreign country . my hats off to the designers and creators of this program . well done ! ! bravo ! muy bien .	5
i ordered this dvd series because i liked kristy alleys performance in other movies and series . but this is totally different . a lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted . after viewing two episodes i put it in the trash . watching this does not make me happy	2
received camera exactly as described . easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again . thank	1
the toothbrush is great , feels like you just came from the dentist and had your teeth cleaned	3
nothing but self-important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age , as mere snipnets of what i thought was going to be a movie were shown . very disappointing , as listing did n't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped	2
it is a great camera , very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances . grainy pic in dim light . go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility . you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card , where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car	1
saw this product , or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns , australia . it was selling for about $70 australia dollars.....which is still quite expensive converted to us$. i came back to u.s. and found it on amazon for $15.99 , with free ship if i purchased $30. so , i bought two......one for myself , one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance , so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks , less the neckchains , which always used to get tangled . it 's an ingenius invention	3
rare are the electronic albums that are so consistantly inspired . melodies are beautifully simple and soothing , sounds are particularly well crafted . a great album . the drum box could be a bit more discreet though	4
i just love lynch mixed with dooms production . it is what real is	4
i have had this camera for about six months and i still find new features to play with . one of my favorite mode is the sequence shots . i love its sleek design and its durable shell . i carry the camera in my back pocket , even in my tightest jeans . this is a great camera	1
i am a jew living in a college town in mississippi for the past 5 years . i was born & raised in the north . i think evans should rename his book " fiddler on the roof in the south " . his book is a very nostalgic look back at jewish history - as it was in the past here . it 's very much : the southern jews were all so happy , they all fit in and were accepted , etc. he does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us ' yankee jews ' , like the instances when a few ( yankee ) rabbis in the south fought for civil rights . evans should realize that times have really changed here ! the evangelical christians in my town ( which is most people here ) harrass me like crazy - ' i am praying for you ! ' ' have you read the words of jesus , who was a jew like you ? ' ' when will you come to my church' . blah , blah , blah . thank god for the minority of catholics , methodists , presbyterians and a few others who live here . they are the only ones to accept me for the way i am , and the way i will stay - a jew . i want all who are reading this to realize that i am only speaking for my experience . jews who reside in cities in the south have told me that they have had far better experiences , and that they cannot relate to what i am saying . but i do want to ask evans a few questions : 1 ) if things are so great for the jews in the south : why have you lived in new york for decades now ? ? ? 2 ) why do n't you at least write either a new forward to the book , a magazine article , etc. , contrasting some of the ways in which the lives of jews in the south have changed over time ( for some of us at least ) , primarily due to the rise of the evangelical christians ? i read evans ' books before i moved here , and nothing much he describes in his books is my life here . for a jew who really cares about her / his religion living here is depressing ; it is practically jew-less ; and , at best , the majority of a certain denomination of christians here ignore me . ( by the way , i am planning to move to a city ! ) by the way , do n't bother writing to me to tell me that i am " wrong " , or to invite me to things like the bible study at your church . believe me , with all the praying for me that is going on in this town , and all the myriad attempts to convert me , if it has n't happened by now , as they say in these parts , it just ai n't gonna happen	0
a classic ! i loved paddington as a child and i 'm thrilled to have this in our cd collection . ( i 'd even listen without the kids ! ) . stephen fry reads the stories very well	0
this is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the bill evans trio . this was i 'm told bill 's first all ballads record . riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962. none of the music sounds dated . considering it 's 41 years old . this is the first recording bill made with chuck israels taking over for the late scott lafaro as the bass player . this album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it . the music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection . one goal that bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and original sounding jazz . i dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording . to me it sounds more like european classical music . also thank god for bill 's college music theory teacher at southeastern university gretchen magee . because if it werent for her motivation {evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition " very early " {which is the last track on the cd its just breathtaking...}being an amature pianist myself , " very early " and " childrens play song " were the first two evans ' compositions i taught myself to play . the piece is a composition played in c major at a slow waltz tempo . he played the tune until the end of his life in 1980 , but the original version on " moonbeams " might be the all around finest one . it is given a very slow and delicate treatment , and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow falling gently around you . i also really like his interpretation of " it might as well be spring " . i think that bill evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that . he didnt play anything he didnt have to . he always played just the right amount of notes and chords . with this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement . evans once told tony bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on " truth and beauty . " with the album " moonbeams " fans of evans ' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album . highly recommended	4
vet producer don was is aboard for this one and he pushes the ladies to write some of their most mature material , relying on their trademark humour as a flavoring rather than a sole ingredient . the result is that even the radio tailored material is better than on " stunt " . best tracks here are : lovers sparring in " too little too late " , twangy " go home " ( possibly the only time you 'll hear a country tune with glockenspiel . parental warning : this is one you 'll want to skip if young ears are in the car because of a gratuitous f-bomb at the coda. . ) , the tale of a co-worker dalliance in " conventioneers " that ends with them feeling awkward about it ( " so i wait , come in late , it 'd be great if you transferred out of state " ) , the cheater finally caught in " humour of the situation " ( " have you heard the one about the boy who moved into the henhouse to sleep ? he woke up with egg on his face , when he found that all the hens had crossed the street " ) and the ethereal " tonight is the night i fell asleep at the wheel " , which utilizes an almost disneyish melody in its tale of a man in a traffic accident who , disembodied , surveys his own demise ( " in all the confusion , there 's something serene , i 'm just a posthumous part of the scene " ) . the least interesting tracks are " off the hook " , another cheater gets him comeuppance tune and " baby seat " , a gentle nudge to accept responsibility instead of wanting others to look after you . bottom line : while not as consistently fabulous as " gordon " , this one hits on all cylinders more than it misses and it utilizes more of the band 's talents by allowing more lead vocals from ed robertson ( " pinch me " , " falling for the first time " ) , as well as kevin 's first on the hidden track " hidden sun " . you also hear the ladies do things they have n't before : steven 's flute on " tonight 's the night i fell asleep at the wheel " , tyler 's 808 drums for " off the hook " , and a dash of retro courtesy of ed 's wah-wah pedal on " conventioneers " and kevin 's vocoder on " humour of the situation "	4
not only do you get some great music with this cd , you get the beginnings of climax as well . ( the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1 / 2 of the band that would play on climax records ) includes their 4 hits ( time wont let me , girl in love , respectable & help me girl ) and a slew of other very like-minded material . if you like any of their 4 hits , you will love the rest . if you like climax , you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes	4

please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature . read this book yourself before giving it to your child . it discusses oral sex , anal sex , how to use and purchase condoms , masturbation ( for girls and boys ) , etc. when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality , she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth , as she would have stopped sucking her thumb . the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within . it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve . for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate	0

this dispenser is easy to install and works perfectly every time . after initially filling the dispensers , it took several pumps for the product to dispense but after that it comes out on the first push of the button . it has been very convenient in my shower and no more shampoo bottles all over the shower ! it also saves on my shampoo because the kids just push the button twice to dispense the amount they need instead of pouring shampoo out of the bottles and using more than they need	3
most people will say that episode one is their least favorite of all the star wars films . but john williams composure for this one is second only to the empire strikes back for the entire star wars trilogy . this extended version is a must have , it contains all the music from the movie . the entire fight scene at the end of the movie is included and its wonderful to listen to . i wish somoone would do the rest of the prequel trilogy like this cd . a must have	0
the software installation is buggy . it try 's to download the entire installation from the snapstream web site , even though there is a installation disk included . if your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall windows . i have windows xp sp2 with a flakey internet connection . although i am computer literate , after two attempts to install this product i have chucked the whole thing out the window . p.s. snapstream has no tech service department to speak of	5
these are very tasty . they take care of a sweet tooth without all the unpronouncable ingredients or being terrible for you . they also are great in a diaper bag , purse , center console of a car for when you get hungry and need something to tie you over until you are at home or whatever your destination	3

i totally agree with soda fizz because im 18 now and i grew up watching these old shows like doug , angry beavers , are u afraid of the dark , rocco , pete and pete , all that , etc.. . they sould put those shows on in rotation and put them out on dvd , im sure there are tons of people out there who would buy them ( me being one of them ) . bring back the old shows	2
that i bought this movie orginally to see david boreanaz naked . i am very glad that i did . it is a very funny comedy that was a bonus of david 's nice tush in the movie . if you have ever been a baby sitter in your life , you will get a hoot out of this one	2
this unit has the power transformer at the wall socket end instead of in the handheld part . the handheld part is mostly made of plastic . so , it 's pleasantly light to hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . the supplied guard things ( that you swap to change length , etc. ; iirc they range from 1 / 8 " to 1 " ) have a curve on the bottom so it 's easier to have them glide over concave surfaces instead of digging the pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . do n't believe the no-mess story , though . it really does catch most of the hair , so it 's certainly worthwhile , and it 's easy to empty the hair trap , but i still have to vacuum the remainder afterwards . it does n't catch it all	3
i recently purchased this camera and i 'm loving it . as a whole it 's very easy to use and carry . i 'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera . i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time	1
i 'm a huge matchbox fan and i listen to a collection of all 3 albums all day long . i never get tired of it ! rob thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me . his lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me . what a great band ! what a great album ! what a great musical ride !	4
for those who were fortunate enough to aquire one of the first two releases of the thief soundtrack ( like myself ) congratulations - you have the version of the cd that contains the best song on the soundtrack , beach scene . it has been dropped for this us release . for those who were interested in obtaining the thief soundtrack being mainly interested in the one song , beach scene ( most of the other songs can be found on other tangerine dream albums ) , please realise the following differences between beach theme and the now dropped , beach scene . the song , beach theme is a much shorter track ( almost by half ) and there is a very cheesy , acoustic , " rock n ' roll " , drum beat that was mixed / dubbed over the original beach scene song which has the much more mellow and less invasive electronic , sequenced drum beat in it . it 's beach scene that was both heard in the movie and over the airwaves back in 1981. if that is the song you remember ( fell in love with ) and are looking for , do not buy this latest release . keep looking for those out of print cds - they are out there . on a lighter " note " , it 's very nice to see they added the ending / end-credits song , confrontation . this is a lose / win scenario for thief soundtrack fans - it all depends on which song is more important to you . if you already have the earlier releases with beach scene on it then buying this latest version will now complete a defninitve soundtrack for them as that last song in the movie has now finally been added to the official soundtrack	4
in this book you get 35 projects / designs marked with skill levels needed for each project . the projects are mostly made with wire , but pearls are also used , in most of the projects . i would say that this is a book for you who has made jewelry before and are familiar to wirework . if so it is a wonderful book ! this book offer lots and lots of inspirasjon and expertise	0

pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in ... hold on ... let me start again . pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting ... dang it ! give me a few minutes here ... pinnacle studio can assist ... ( samuel l jackson-styled expletive ) ... how many times is this gonna happen ? start and stop ! start and stop ! enough already ! one more time . now , what was i saying ? oh , yeah ... pinnacle studio can assist the amateur videographer in editing some fairly interesting video ... if you can keep it up and running . got the idea ? just adding my voice to the chorus of those have experienced the frustration of the pinnacle products . this is a bargain-priced product for which you will pay the cost of long hours of irritation and heart-pounding races to meet project deadlines -despite the software malfunctions . after installing the program , installing the patches , uninstalling the program and patches and reinstalling the program and the patches , i am still experiencing too many crashes . if you intend to use this program to piece together a video of uncle morty 's birthday party , the family vacation or your neighbor 's kid 's bar mitzvah , the cost and the ease of this program may outweigh the annoyance of its aforementioned weakness . if , however , your video projects fit under the category of " job description , " then i suggest spending the money for adobe premiere	5

i have used intuit products since 1992 , and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when intuit began installing hidden software on users ' computers in an attempt to " stop piracy " , which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program . secondly and even more significantly , i began noticing an apparent shift in intuit 's philosophy toward it 's customers : cut back on customer support , and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money . in short , intuit disrespects their customers . as a loyal paying customer , i will not be disrespected or taken for granted . their level of service and support has declined . their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on intuit as you try to use their programs . that is why i have sworn off intuit products when there is an alternative . why reward someone who treats you badly ?	5
although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .	3
i was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year . a third of a way through it , it starting to skip and freeze . i played it all the way through but took forever . at the ending it was workinhg again . , but i missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage . i guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used . wo n't be doing this again !	2

" cursed " is the most pathetic werewolf movie i 've seen since " an american werewolf in paris " . the acting is terrible , directing is poor ( shame on you mr. craven ) and the storyline is largely uncompelling . the werewolves look ridiculous and the whole movie really comes off as a total joke to a sophisticated adult horror movie audience . this movie seems to cater to the teens and early 20s people who might think something like this is " cool " , but if you 're looking for a scary movie , do n't look for " cursed " . well , at least it 's not as bad as " an american werewolf in paris " , but that sure as hell is n't saying much .	2
a friend of mine turned me on to spoon , and at first i listened enthusicatically.. . but then i got bored . although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times , they are empty and deviod of any alterations . the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so , but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track . if this is 5 star music today , our culture is severely lacking depth	4

everyone has their favorite beatle . some people love to complain about paul 's solo music , comparing it to john's . the fact is that each of the beatles had their own style , and together they had a magical symbiosis . separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew . so paul 's music is light hearted ? maybe even silly ? sure , but if you are like me and enjoy each beatle for what they brought to the group , then this is a wonderful album . no you wo n't find deep soul searching here , just fun ! and fun is what this album has in abundance . so if you want to curse paul for his naivet , do n't buy this album . if you loved the beatles , and enjoyed each one for their individual talent , this is a fun solo album . in my humble opinion it is paul 's best solo album , as he really spreads his " wings " and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear . later albums seem to become too engineered , and never seem to have the same energy that this album has .	4
tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d-524 camera . turned out to be a downgrade . did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts . it would die a sudden death - - no low battery warnings before the camera shut down . i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts . the cr-v3 now gathers dust . it did not even improve the flash recycle time . just a waste	1
i purchased partition magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with symantec virus protection and firewall products . i am sorry that i did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by symantec for other products that i have purchased from them . all i wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my c : drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive . i was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with symantec technical support . i was only able to speak to technical support staff in india who finally told me that they could not solve my problem , but that i would be called back by a senior engineer . it never happened despite repeated promises . i finally gave up and returned the product to symantec for a refund .	5
( 4.5 / 5 stars ) exceptional envisioning of the batman comic book by tim burton . michael keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality . contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in " batman begins ; " both are equally effective , though one style over the other will likely appeal to you . is there any topping jack nicholson in his role as jack napier / the joker ? only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie . even though his role is suitably funny , there is a little too much humor overall in the movie . robert wuhl 's character is especially unnecessarily comical . also , while danny elfman 's score is duly heroic and compelling , the music by prince just does n't mesh well and is probably not the best choice . nonetheless , the visuals are stunning , the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining . it is a testament to the film 's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used danny elman scores ( including rival marvel 's " spider-man " ) and molded black rubber suits , though this film also owes much to 1978 's " superman " with its realistic approach and a-list villains . great stuff .	2
great software ! until you have a question or a problem that is . then you get the run around big time ! zonealarm says they did n't sell it to me so they ca n't help me . they send me to broderbund for help . broderbund then sends me to encore for help and they wo n't help me either . zonealarm states if i did n't buy it right from zonealarm then they do n't give any support . it comes in a zonealarm box , says zonealarm on the cd but apparently it is n't zonealarm ? ? ?

asks the interviewer , " what place would you give shoot the piano player in relation to your other films ? " answers director françois truffaut , " no place . simply the second film i made . " considering his first feature film was the four hundred blows and his third was jules et jim , truffaut 's matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile . shoot the piano player is worth smiles , too . it 's a clever film , playful at times , even funny . more than anything , however , it defies categorization . the movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy , suspense and inevitability , tragedy and love , and gangsters , girl friends and violence . it 's the story of charlie koller ( charles aznavour ) , a piano player in a paris dive , who used to be eduoard saroyan , a famous pianist , whose wife committed suicide . truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man . charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants . he ca n't go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing . he thinks about what he should do , but ca n't do it , and then circumstances take over . charlie , thanks to his brothers , finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow . some say shoot the piano player is an homage to american gangster films . perhaps it is , but i challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie . the film is original , funny , moving and sad . it 's the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about . all i know is that i was moved by charlie . we leave him where we met him , playing piano in a paris dive . charles aznavour , a diminutive man with a hangdog look , plays charlie perfectly . aznavour is probably better known in the u. s . as a singer , but in france he 's seen as both an actor and a singer . he 's a minimalist , he says about himself . charlie thinks too much and does too little . aznavour lets us see into charlie 's soul with few words . it 's a marvelous performance that left me saddened by charlie , but liking him . the criterion dvd transfer is first-rate . criterion gives us two discs . the first has the movie and a commentary track . the second disc contains interviews by aznavour and marie dubois , who played charlie 's girlfriend , lena , plus excerpts from documentaries featuring truffaut , and other extras . the criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and truffaut	2

i ca n't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album . the lyrics must have come out of a dadaist poetry circle , and ( most of ) the guitar work is completely without personality . what is the criterion of a good rock album ? by any standards it must be a joy to play it . 6teen stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional . but it does n't so much incite anger than it does disdain for bush 's attempts to emulate nirvana . where nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist , evocative lyrics , bush has dull , throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger . there 's not much more to say about 6teen stone . i could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like " swim " : thinning ice / 14 hairdryers / swimming to you / flame on earth desire . " or the artistic suicide of the last track , " x-girlfriend " , a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that 's about six words long . that 's about all i can tell you . mostly i figure i 've done enough warning to let you make your own choice . if you do attempt this though , you ought to be told the little good news that there is : there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album , split between " machinehead " and " glycerine . " the first is an energetic , well-constructed song about control ( you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on total request live ) , the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars , a trembling cello , and a surprisingly coherent rossdale . they hold the album ; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building .	4
hugh farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play bridge . his college-age daughter karen , her friend barbara , his lawyer son duke , his alcoholic wife grace , and house servant joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit . everyone scrambles to safety inside hugh 's modern bomb shelter . as the bombs fall and his wife is passed out , hugh starts up an affair with his daughter 's friend barbara , right in the shelter . as if hugh 's shallowness and arrogance was n't enough to turn you against the protagonist , this nauseating little scene will . when the shakes and quakes finally end , the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible , pristine , clean world . at first glance , it looks like utopia , but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race , imprisoned , and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves . somehow , hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in , so that he can be free with barbara . of all the apocalypse fiction , this book is the worst . the protagonist is so lowbrow , so arrogant , so unlikable , so self-centered , so shallow , so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest . he 's not even a " love to hate " person . the dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant , and barbara and hugh 's constant prattlings of " darling , dear , and beloved " do not fit the characters . neither does hugh 's occasional spouting of words like " shall " and " sha n't " along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the " n " word . there is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of hugh 's daughter and barbara 's friend karen , cannibalism , castration ( hugh cared more about his " boys " than he did his real children ) , pedophilia , racism , and $exual slavery , they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut . the entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it , as if the author himself did n't quite believe his story . and if he does n't believe , how can he expect the reader to ? overall , there is no depth or flavor in this story at all , other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight , as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door . i recommend avoiding this book .	0
i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the 80s . unfortunately , instead of picking up on the latest influence of 80s music in dance music , what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated , with some latin tones now and then . the only semi retro / electro tracks on here ( and my favorites ) are feel for you , love bite , your love is like a drug , and marc almond 's remix of venus . the two lead singles " move in my direction " and " look on the floor " are not even the strongest tracks ! and the remixes on their singles do n't make them much better . i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken , but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this . take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne ( ! ) to hear some infectious melodies with an 80s flair that do n't melt down into total cheese . unfortunately , i just do n't see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc . but of course , fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection . it 's listenable , if not up to today 's standards	4
i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 ( which i loved ) , and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds . what a disappointment this " upgrade " has been . crash after crash . what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could " help " them develop a better product . this means to me that they knowingly released bad code , and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100. guess what , i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product . i want a product that works when i purchase it . lesson learned . next time i read a bad review on a product , i 'm staying away	5
unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide , and fortified roots reggae album ! if you do n't have firehouse rock in your cd collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan , you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about jamaican music . the roots radics , especially the rythym section , utilize ( with supreme efficacy , i might add ) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae " riddims . " on top of the radics , the wailing souls add ethereal vocals , while staying masterfully conscious . firehouse rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible jamaican history and an absolute must have	4
one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm . no way ! . those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences . this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring . the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then , the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through . unless you are a serious kayaking fan , i would not recommend this book	0
this album is a real let down and it pains me to say so , since i really do like the kol . the first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked . i did n't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling . it did n't matter because the songs were great.but on this cd they 've opted for an experimental sound that does n't measure up . innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in charmer-what the heck is up with that ? how often do you want to listen to it ? once was enough for me . i was n't expecting the pixies here . and then there 's the reverb employed on song after song-why ? it just degenerates into white noise . there are a couple of good tracks on the dics - black thumbnail , for one . but then there are throwaway tunes like camaro , which is about as clique as you can get . that said , art is subjective , and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews . but i find most of it unlistenable.i can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating ; this is definitely not one of them	4
this is absolutely the worse digital device i have ever owned . the manual is worthless and the web site even worse . i try to delete the included photos , and nothing happens . i ca n't download photos from my mac . if your digital memory card has many photos , good luck trying to find the ones you want to download to the frame .	1
we all feel alone at times.. . this is something ' lost in translation ' brilliantly shows its audience. . indeed loneliness often , paradoxically , occurs in highly populated areas. . it is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out.. . bill murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy , who dose n't seem to quite know why he is where he is , and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality. . this is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola. . it captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top. . this also sort of represents the zenith of bill murray 's career and perhaps his best performance to date .	2
i love this backpack ! it is just what i needed to safely carry my camera gear and keep it organized	1
gunstories by beth atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for all students and discussed with parents , teachers , and friends . young people discuss guns in a positive light and a negative light . as with any subject , it is only with education and knowledge that a change can be made . i definitely recommend this book and hope that it can be a fixture in all elementary , middle , and high schools . ( p.s. if you are a school librarian , order a copy ! ! ) - shelley ( henderson , nv ) a fascinating look at a difficult topic ! many viewpoints are presented , the book is fair and balanced . but the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting . the dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking . the wonderful photography really adds to the text . recommended . - diane ( cedar rapids , ia ) despite the fact that i 'm not really in support of guns , it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda . it 's not your typical pro / con book either . it gives actual perspectives from real life people...teen people who just want to tell it like it is . - amy ( fort worth , tx	0
nearly two years of ownership and it has been a great purchase . i have no shame dorking up my drinking . use to ensure legal driving or for ill advised contests . also determine what at what bac memory gets spotty ( what point is there exceeding that ? ) . fun to call out big talkers who do n't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts . also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive . pros precision to third decimal place . rare at this price at time of my purchase very repeatable with consistant deep breath small enough to take to bars in jacket pocket or cargo pockets . light for its size . cons innaccurate if sips have been taken within 10 minutes or so . true for all breathalyzers . drunk idiots have tough time getting it through their heads warm up / calibration time ~45 sec . another let down at parties but perhaps key to accuracy would be nice if it was more pocket sized chirps at you alarm clock style if above .08 " i know i 'm drunk , shut up !	3

i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day . they are comfortable , easy to focus , and a great choice for the price . these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel , concerts , sports , etc	1
i have a pretty complicating sleep schedule because of my graveyard shift at our local convenient store , with school and all it 's kind of hard keeping my sleep schedule straight . i 've tried many sleep aids and this one worked the best for me , no grogginess which is totally awesome for the days i have class early !	3
wow ! tom morello , flea , pete yorn , chris cornell , brad wilk , maynard james keenan . when i first heard of this superstar line-up , i was sure that this cd was going to be awesome . i was duped like everyone else who bought this album . axis of justice ( or so cleverly put by a previous reviewer as " axis of jackasses " ) is really a bad album , even for a bunch of political liberal rockers . serj and tom really dropped the ball with this one . what could 've been a festoon of awesomeness turned out to crap-fest of whiny musicians with an equally crappy message . knowledge , the night watchmen , and ahmed ahmed are among the many reasons why this is so bad and incredibly difficult to listen to . the song , " jeffrey , are you listenng ? " is up there with other crappy songs like john mayer 's " city love " and richard harris ' " macarthur park . " on top of all that , the communist entertainer known as michael moore adds his little nugget of wisdom on the dvd , which i can say i 've become dumber now that i 've listened to it . for the love of all good music , stay far away from this cd	4
i love the tingler ! each metal tip feels great . i personally like the copper version a little better than the silver version . it 's a little gentler and softer but i know some people find it too soft and like the silver version instead . before the tingler , sometimes i would use one end of my glasses ( the end that fits over the ear ) but of course my glasses are fragil and i would risk damaging them . it also feels really good on the back and actually all over , not just on the head	3
the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel , and is more user-friendly . i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application , which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print . some functionality as before , with some new organization and better look / feel	5
wow ! this was a pretty decent romantic comedy . we had this in our collection for months ( possibly years ) and never watched it . we decided to watch this film on a whim . i have to say that it was better and ever funnier than i thought it would be . monica potter is great in her role . it 's a sweet movie that actually does n't do to much guy bashing ( the reason so many guys hate romantic comedies ) . i am also a big fam of henry thomas , and he is great at as well . i wo n't go into the plot here , as many others already have . but what i am simply amazed with as many bad romantic comedies that get released in theatres ( sweet home alabama & 13 going on 30 ) that a movie like this never got mainstream attention . the other thing that must be said is , with virtually no cute romatic female leads under 40 ( and over 18 ) , why is n't monica potter more famous than she is . she can easily be the next julia roberts , or meg ryan . julia has 2 kids and meg has just hit the wall , it 's time for a beauty like monica potter to get into the very lucrative romantic comedy genre . here 's hoping she gets a better agent before it 's to late . cute movie , with a good heart . definetly made a date night at home wonderful . -mark ( for the record 32yrs old , straight and yes i enjoyed this movie )	2
it took so long for this to come out...i hated the little hints they gave us hardcore nders on the dare to play message board . i had extremely high hopes for this game- -i adored last train to blue moon canyon and waited ages for this game . now , besides the absurd level of difficulty in this game [it was seemingly very hard in my eyes- -i could not make it the first time through without the assistance of a walkthrough] , i loved it . the flight to paris and the travel about the city- -it was also a lot easier to make money in this game than in secret of the old clock . i did not like how hard the puzzles were , but all in all it was an amazing game . there was a lot of talking , and that can really slow down gameplay and frustrate a gamer . and puzzles like the darkroom , the paintbomb and the cookies were absurdly difficult . but otherwise it was worth it	5
honestly , i do n't know how much more they can improve adobe acrobat . it is an excellent product , and a god-send for electronic file management . i upgraded from version 6.0. the only problem i had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , and files seem to " print " to it much more quickly than version 6.0. i do not utilize the " one-button " feature it provides in ms office and other programs . i try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible , because my previous experiences showed that they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i do n't come close to using all the features of acrobat , but for my needs , it far surpasses anything else i 've tried ( or researched ) . if you 're having problems with version 6.0 , or have an older version that you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i do n't foresee ever needing to upgrade acrobat again	5
i was very disappointed with this product . not only did it come in a foreign ( chinese ) box , it does n't work well at all . the " powder " that was included actually made it worse . if i were you , i would keep searching	3
vista is appropriated named . vista defines something great to look at . if all you did was look at microsoft vista it would be the perfect operating system indeed . unfortunately vista is a computer operating system that was designed to be used and there is the problem . vista is so secure and so over burdened with layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer of sheer garbage it is rendered totally completely and utterly useless . vista will take the fastest xp computer and turn it into a slow worthless pile of trash . vista is so slow it takes me back to the days when i used to walk away from my ibm at computer get a cup of coffee and walk around the building . what makes vista worse still is microsoft office 2007 the absolute pits in word processing . add office 2007 to vista and you wo n't be productive at all but dang wo n't it look pretty . if you just want to watch your computer make pretty colors and areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch vista . when you want to work and be productive turn on your xp computer . windows 2000 and xp work hard while vista hardly works at all . vista is garbage do n't buy this dreck ! everything you try to do on vista is not allowed . almost every peice of equipment you run on vista needs to be updated to so called vista friendly versions . the messed up windows explorer to the point to where it is beyond useless . the problem with vista is that microsoft had taken all the wizards and helpful features far as they could in xp . in vista they had to try to top a operating system that pretty much did what you asked of it with little fuss . in vista the software code writers were just changing things because they could . vista makes nothing better or easier . in fact vista is built in a manner that almost seems to go out of its way to make even the most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring and tedious . in a word tedious is the best single word to describe microsoft windows vista . vista has succeeded in bringing the entire computer experience is painfully new level of the purely tedious that has not been dreamt of before ! i just wish i could give vista no stars or more honestly a negative star rating . i wo n't be buying vista for my current systems and even when i get a new computer i will not be using vista is it comes pre installed . i have my own old trusty xp disks and i will reinstalled xp the last useful usable operating system microsoft made . xp is the goofy kiddie skool like interface is ugliest operating system microsoft ever made but while it was an ugly duckling it did work pretty well . vista is by far the prettiest operating system microsoft has ever made but it is pretty and dumb . vista is over burdened with programmatic junk has a way to high opinion of itself . vista is so much more secure because all the dumb security features make the operating system unusable . any computer you make unusable is the most secure because you ca n't do any productive work on it . vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious and makes your computer system a must see door stop . the philosophy of vista seems to be that a good computer should be seen but never productively used . vista is a great system for that well monied executive that wants to look busy while doing nothing productive	5
this is a good product but.. . unfortunately webrrot feels no need to stand by its current marketing claims of : free software updates spy sweeper is continuously updated to provide you with the most advanced and effective spyware protection . as a spy sweeper customer , you receive these updates to our software absolutely free . this is simply not the case they have now instituted an anual subscription update fee like the big boys . when i addressed this with them on the phone they suggested i take it up with the vendor " fry 's electronics " they should have warned you . our issues are concern over the future marketing claims made by this manufacturer . they will also say you should have read the small print.. . we guess their interpritation of free and the rest of the world 's is a little different . who knows what they will decide in the future . we are seriously disappointed in webroot	5
i had ordered this item expecting good things from it . however , the article has never worked properly . the electrical system seems to be working fine , but the uv light has never come on . somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize . right now the product is only a toothbrush holder ; nothing more . i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder . i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it . in short , i wo n't buy anything like this again	3
the film is pretty lightweight on a whole but it has a nice charm with a well known hollywood cliche in film making.i applaud the effort.the chicks in this film are happening babes fo sho.but there ai n't much to the film but it has some fun to it	2
" backbeat " is an excellent portrayal of the hamburg phase of the early beatles , and succeeds on every level . although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of " fifth beatle " stuart sutcliffe , the focus quickly shifts to john lennon who ( as in real life ) dominated the music and lives of the early beatles . it is as much the story of stu and john as the story of stu and astrid , and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships . still , it is a fascinating look at the early beatles , who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years . the cast is excellent , and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed . the music is also excellent , and complements the story perfectly . in all , " backbeat " is an entertaining journey through the world of the early beatles , and is well worth purchasing for repeat viewings .	2
other similar products were too complicated . all i wanted was something simple . i got exactly what i needed to convince myself i had my act together . i found it in this product . big e-z bookkeeping helped me simplify my bookkeeping without the anxiety . it 's just enough for my family accounts . thank you	5
i have moderate knowledge of computers , etc. and i found this overly complicated . this is not intended for the novice . however , even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money . i wish i had not bought it at all . perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of...but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them . save your money...this was a waste	5
it 's a great concept , but my unit was n't recognized by any of my 3 pc 's , despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit . one of my pcs runs xp ( they had no idea why this computer did n't recognize the magpix ) and the others run win98 ( which they said sometimes has problems with the magpix , although they do n't say that in their marketing literature ) . they gave me my money back , but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised , and in addition i wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them . i suggest waiting for the next version , or even better , for a better company to introduce a similar product	1
if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one	1
john waters is a very brilliant and odd film director . he brings camp , trash , filth , humor and morality to all of his movies , pushes peoples buttons , goes farther than most dare ( and then some ) isnt afraid of being censored and does what he does and to me thats brillance . true alot of people will think his work is tasteless stupid and gross but thats the whole point ! lol ! people who dont have a sense of humor or who are not open minded will not like his movies . these are not for right wing conservatives but they should see them ( especially a dirty shame ) to broaden their minds a little more . my personal favorites are pink flamingos , a dirty shame , female trouble , polyester and desperate living . serial mom is also a fav but not in this collection . he has come from underground trash to queen of filth , trash and crudeness and for not being afraid of being bold , outlandish , outspoken and bizzar , i applaud you john waters . brillant	2
while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool , i found it did not help with conversation .	5
this is a fabulous gift for grandparents if you preload the pictures . just be aware that the customer support folks are not that knowledgeable , probably since the product is new . do n't bypass their software to load the pix if you 're transferring from your pc to the frame - their software reduces the memory needed for each one . and even though the software for different size frames is labelled the same , it is not compatible and you can only have one version installed on your pc at a time	1
i finished it because a friend recommended it , but had she not , i would have quit after page 20. i was n't interested in the story or writing . i did n't find the story grotesque ; i 've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book , but i just did n't find the protagonist very interesting . he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation . we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs , to redeem himself . his actions did n't seem out of line , either during the war or during the plague , given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences . i know this is a great example of a book written in second person , and perhaps for that it is worth reading . i would n't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure	0
it 's a pretty convinient bag.i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28-75 lens , a canon 70-300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet , keys etc. the only drawback of this bag is , you can not put in big lenses.the canon 70-300 is the limit.but if you only have a limited gear collection , you need to give it a try	1
i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book . unfortunately , i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages . i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away . the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard . no character seems to even approach reality . they are all , including the main character and her love interest , over the top	0

i was never a diehard huey lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll . if you 're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection , this one is worth the price of admission . i 'm not familiar with all the original members so just having huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as i remembered them , it was memorable , high-energy performance . one little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me . about halfway through the show , huey 's shirt had a meltdown . all of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour . am i the only one that noticed this ? but it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had . who could ask for more	2
this was a hot mess , it was so boring i could n't even finish the book , i passed it on to my cusion , and she said the same thing , i just gave the book away . my hopes were all high from flyy gryl , but thats the only good book that omar written . i was so upset by this that i actually wanted to write omar tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on . i mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book . i hate reading a bad book because i feel it is just a waist of my time , and i could 've done somthing better . omar , you owe my 4 hours of a good book	0
i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera . the color and noise was terrible . if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available . the camera has pro features , it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag . if you want to see s50 pictures go to [...] and search my gallery cathreen styles . all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50. i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks . by the way , i did end up buy a pro camera , mainly because of the look . i got the canon 30d and love it	1
this is the second novel in the mystery series featuring marcus didius falco , an informer and sleuth . a series of books that have become hugely popular , so much so that the author is now at the forefront of historical mystery writers . it was probably a stroke of genius on her part to have novels that are extremely well researched and contain all the elements that would be and should be found in rome in ad70 , but to have a lead character who has the vocabulary of a present day new york cop . in this novel the hero marcus didius falco has returned from the remote island of britannia , a god forsaken place whose people are morose and surly and the weather , well the weather is best left to its own devices . marcus has lost his heart to senator 's daughter helena but is not sure that the passion he feels is reciprocated . why is that women he is not interested in , fall over themselves to get to him , but the one that he has lost his heart to , treats him with a cool disdain ? he has not long returned to the welcoming arms of rome before a series of fatal accidents and things that go bump in the night convince falco and the emperor that there are traitors still conspiring and they must be brought to book . falco is not happy , it seems he must leave his beloved rome yet again , but the conspirators are serious about their plans and will not let anyone stand in their way . will falco ever return . .	0

tiger is simply the most advanced personal operational system on earth ! i am an advanced used . i have used all sorts of operational systems in the last decades : irix ( unix from silicon graphics ) , sunos ( unix from sun ) , linux , and also the bad written windows . everytime i used windoze in the last 20 years , i had to deal with crashes , hanging , lost of data and hours of configurations , tuning , adjusts , cleaning , etc. even today , everytime i shutdown windoze , it hangs , due to some program crashing . it 's a true joke ! ! ! on february 2005 i decided to buy a mac and give it a try . i bought a mac mini and started using it . what i have to say is that i am using it for more than an year without an issue , without a crash . system is solid as rock . some bad written programs eventually crash , but never the system . and i am the kind of guy who works with several heavy programs with heavy documents opened at the same time . mac never crashed . i am about to suggest apple a way to make it crash , so we can rest a little bit , instead of working all the time . so much trouble i had in the past with windoze that even today , while i am using the mac , i feel like it will crash at any time . fortunately it never crashed . beyond those functions advertised by apple , you will see that macos is a superb gold mine for those who want to explore under the hood . filled with thousands of powerfull unix commands and programs , you will be able to perform miracles . microsoft is copying everything it can from tiger and advertising it as revolutionary features of up comming windows ( hasta la ) vista . i cannot see a single revolutionary function on vista , as everything already exists on tiger . the most amazing is some sites on the web comparing vista ( a vaporware not yet launched ) with tiger ( an actual product ) . the only thing gates forgot is that one month after vista is released , apple will launch leopard that will take the crown from tiger . what i can say you is that for the first time on years i have joy of using a personal computer .	5
what a horrendous experiment in comedy...if you like jerry lewis , i guess you 'll love this travesty of a film . if you are a film snob , you will love it . personally , as neither , i am grossly disappointed and just really did n't get & quot ; the joke . &quot ; it was trite and dull....there was no point....the plot...technology encroaching on humanity....well , good try , but again not for me . if i am looking for a laugh , i will watch a good coen brothers film	2
these guys are not artists . they are unimaginative lamebrains unwittingly and badly rewriting already overplayed music from a long dead scene . it 's like a few monkeys build a house , and all the other monkeys rave about it , but in reality the house is just a banana tree with a welcome mat.. . whatever that means . i am constantly astounded as to how waste like this gets on the radio . buy this cd if you want to vomit everywhere .	4

this is the worst novel that i have ever read by a major author . i have read a couple other alex cross novels and i did not find them to be awful at all . they were n't very good but they kept me turning the page . while i was reading this dreck i began to get a sense of patterson 's work ethic . he sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it . one maybe two chapters per day i suppose , and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result . not a snowball 's chance in hell that this would have been published if it were n't written by patterson . i 'm done . do n't waste your time . really	0
this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington before this product gives me nothing but trouble	3

this is the best tasting energy bar i have ever had . my kids love them too . great high energy snack	3
i think this is the best version to come out yet . i would have a high end pc if i was to upgrade only software . i would just wait and buy a new pc . its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security . the firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there . its got alot more features and run 's good's . device drivers are easyier to load -scott	5
the night owl optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as i started using it . the system uses high voltage derived from 2-aa bateries . occationally the unit would create a large snap ( arcing noise ) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece . if one is using the instrument , the light actually hurts the eye . i have returned the monocular to night owl for repairs . i do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit . they told me to ship it at my expense . another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours . other than the above , the monocular has performed well . epilogue-night owl optics did repair the unit and returned it .	1
i was a huge fan of the jam , but ive grown to despise paul weller and this cd strengthens my view . this is a covers cd and has n't got a patch on albums like all mod cons or sound affects.with paul weller everything is about a quick buck and ripping off a loyal fan base , with over a dozen jam compilations , rarities , box sets and dvd 's in the last few years.[since he bought the exclussive rights to all the jam recordings from the rest of the band].this album is bland so give it a miss and spend your money on the new stiff little fingers cd which features bruce foxto	4
i assume you already know what 's on this recording or you would n't be here , right ? do n't you probably have a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you have n't listened to for years because it 's dusty and has scratches and pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway ? well , i wo n't review the music here because others have done better than i would , but i will say that listening to this remaster through a high quality set of headphones ( sennheiser ) has enabled me to hear this as if it were the first time . it 's totally worth the money to get this new version , and the bonus tracks just make it even more fun .	4
i still have not received this dvd . it was ordered on 12 / 8 / 06 and was supposed to ship on 12 / 12 / 06. i am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a christmas gift . i cannot rate the product as i do n't have it . i sent an e-mail through amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them . i would appreciate a response or a refund	2

i use this gem on my 20d along with my 24-105mm , and as far as i 'm concerned it is one of the best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 is n't the ideal indoor / low light lens nor is it the ideal sports photography lens ( although it is sharp , just not quite long enough ) the 70-200 fills in that gap in my arsenal with is to boot ! the photos i 've taken so far on the sidelines are all keepers . if you can afford it , do it , you wo n't regret i	1
microsoft office can be handy to have . the files you can open , edit and create with it ( most notably .doc , .xls , and .ppt ) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it 's ( relatively ) intuitive . it has a pretty broad array of useful functions . it 's also obscenely expensive , considering the fact that you can get all of these things - - .doc , .xls , and .ppt ; intuitive interface ; and functionality - - for free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i was looking for basic functionality , but i was pleasantly surprised ; openoffice does most of the neat tricks , too . ( actually , it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate : it 's open source , so it can respond to the needs of individual users . you just say " add this neat trick ! " and someone will likely be able to do it for you . ) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice doesn't . but considering the price differential , i would n't splurge on this before checking .	5
.. with an all-star cast . the plot is not new ( stage door , how to marry a millionaire and valley of the dolls to mention but a few ) , but judy , hedy and lana do an admirable job . never mind highbrow critcs ; hedy lamarr wasn ` t that bad and lana does one of her best acting jobs ever . judy is a tomboy and it ` s sad that life eventually took her into the direction of lana ` s character sheila . the musical numbers are good , but sadly ; footage from the great ziegfeld are edited in ( note the finale ) . james stewart are good as well - as are edvard everett horton , charles winninger and eve arden . the film is filled with good 1-liners and there are even echoes of garbo ` s first sound-entrance in anna christie	2
i 'm the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir , the house on telegraph hill , but it does n't matter , because all the actors are good , and combined with an extremely effective plot , the movie is a terrific tale of murder , deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco . as was the fashion with many noir films of the time , the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine . she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale , and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened . however , the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war , and we meet victoria kopwelska ( valentina cortese ) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen . with her husband and family dead , victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett ( william lundigan ) that there 's nothing for her back in poland . desperate to survive , victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states , and if they are ever freed , she promises to take victoria to america with her . her friend however , is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp . with nowhere to go , victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend 's papers and sail to america , where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris ( gordon gebert ) , as well as the heir to a sizable fortune , and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill , following the death of her " aunt . " ensconced in the ostensible mansion , victoria , now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy 's guardian alan spender ( richard basehart ) , partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security . as victoria becomes a " mother " to the boy , she clashes with his governess margaret ( fay baker ) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen , now a studly a playboy type lawyer . all the adults are not as they seem : marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money , and victoria 's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme . victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good . and then there 's the margaret , the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem . the film is compelling , and tension-fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white . cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria , she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade , yet through no fault of her own , she steadily becomes a victim of alan 's scheming . of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco . the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay . the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers - there 's a runaway car , poisoned orange juice , an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity . it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film . victoria starts out as a victim , and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill , her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris . mike leonard april 06.	2
these ' cartridges ' sell for about $2 a piece , plus shipping . i recently switched from the mach 3 turbo to a merkur double edge safety razor and i can safely say i will never go back . the mach 3 provides a decent enough shave ( much better than an electric , in my experience ) but the single blade is actually much smoother . i pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the mach 3 at $1.50- $2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days	3
if you get it wet it stops working , which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush . if you want something to work for a month or two its fine , otherwise avoid it entirely . i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture , pretty quickly after ordinary use	3
this cd brings back memories of the early 60 's when vince martin and fred neil played at the flick , the coffee house , and the hootenanny here in miami . i 've had the lp forever . now that i 'm getting the cd , i can listen in my car and remember seeing them perform live	4
as a dad , i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old . this book is lousy though . why ? 1. stupid writing . i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy , " witty " remarks . " dancing the potty mambo " ? give me a break ! 2. stupid advice . this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he / she is an adult . i 'm sorry , but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or do n't want them to do something . how about just saying , " do n't do that ! " or " hey , you want to try this ? " that seems to work just fine for me . why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something ? what 's wrong with just telling your kid what to do ( nicely ) , and expecting them to be obedient ? 3. repeating content . this book kept repeating itself over and over . okay , i got it already ! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages ( or less ) . 4. too many references . this book constantly refers to other chapters . i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page . i am not kidding ! huh ? is potty training really that freakin ' complicated ? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it , how to get started , and a few good tips . i do n't need all these detailed references . ( nor do i need the phrase " potty mambo " repeated to me ad infinitum . ) here is all i wanted to know : -how do i get started ? -what do i do ? -how often do i need to try it ? -should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment ? maybe this book got to all of that , but i quit after page 60. i just could n't take it anymore . after hearing the phrases " stay positive " and " potty mambo " repeated to me for the umpteenth time , i had to quit . i returned this book and got my money back . if i were to say anything good about this book , i would say that it has a few good tips , surrounded by about 180 pages of filler . potty training still looms ahead . will i be successful ? probably . but to this book i say , no thanks	0
i bought this for my 3yr old twins , and from the first showing , i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons . my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales , so they really loved " the three little pigs " and " the pied piper " . i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children	2
i love this pretenders album and chrissie always rocks but i love the songwriting skill of billy steinberg & tom kelley . they wrote " love colours " , " night in my veins " and the hit " stand by you " . her follow-up to this , " viva ! el amor ! " also contains three tracks written by them . i purchased this long after its release and was glad i did . steinberg kelley write memorable hooks and good lyrics with interesting chord changes . something not all big names can do on their own and chrissie wisely is aware of this .	4
after 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise , numerous doctor visits without results , i obtained source of life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them . with the very first dose , i went from dragging around to walking around- -while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen . at my very next doctor 's appointment , i told of my experience with source of life and i continue to report it to anyone and everyone that mentions being excessively tired . members of my family and several friends now regularly use this outstanding product , and have reported similar results . not only did i feel much better with higher energy levels , i also notice fingernail and hair growth as well . i use the liquid version and it is actually very tasty . i highly recommend this product . i 've used it for 3 years and have obtained consistent good results .	3
i am absolutely furious about this book . i quit reading about half-way through . i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life ( chapter 13 ) . in that chapter , i found three mistakes - not minor details , but major , provable points , including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs . if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs , how can i trust the rest of the information in the book ? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	0
i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea . it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong . it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado . i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone .	3

if you love ludlum 's over-the-top novels ( and i do ) , the matarese circle has to be up there with the best . not all of ludlum 's books are a good match of plot and style - - the repeated & quot ; oh my god ! & quot ; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on are n't as riveting as they could be ( the two bourne sequels suffer from this problem , i think . ) but circle delivers on all fronts . part one is a masterpiece all by itself - - the intricate cat-and-mouse game between talienkov and scofield plays out thrillingly . and these are two of ludlum 's most believably drawn characters ; we feel empathy for both , and root for them to join forces from the get-go . antonia gravet , the inevitable gorgeous heroine / love interest who surfaces in part two , brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot . one final bonus : some of ludlum 's zestiest minor characters appear in this book , adding to the fun in nearly every chapter .	0

at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991. i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a " cool " os	5

hello , i recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......but it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings.... . purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings..... . take care and stay healthy..... .	3
the content is excellent . the digital format is largely useless . i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition . but , the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca n't print selected pages to stick in a folder , read on the train , or scribble notes on . i ca n't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic ' notes ' file . the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one	0
lcd fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker was n't stong enough . anyhow , i could push it back . then , the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top . this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual . i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken . this is the problem i ca n't fix . the only thing i can do is sending it back . following up : according to the other review , i tried to make this scale " vibrating " using different ways of tapping . it did n't work no matter how hard i tried . i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little ( about half an inch ) and drop it on hard floor to make enough " vibration " to turn it on . i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on . my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping . i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate . just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass . and also , be careful to use it in bathroom : moisture will make the glass surface slippery .	3

first up i give this album a 4.5 / 5 for the fac that it has real hiphop beats and good lyrics . real hiphop , they stayed true to the sound . i just didnt give it a 5 since im not the biggest tcq fan and of that style . but all these emcees spit hott lyrics in this album . tracks like " keep it movin " , " hot sex " have ill beats . this album does have a real jazzy sound to it , which im not the biggest fan of , but its more of a unique style , and they deserve props for trying new styles . so overall this is a really good album , and worth getting . my top 5 songs 1.buggin out 2.hot sex 3.oh my god 4.luck of lucien 5.keep it movi	4
the author gives vague advice , the " calm down " , " be objective " cliche advice . if you do n't believe me , i 'm literally quoting him . although the author tries to make his book seem original , as you can read , it 's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances , but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned . this is not something revolutionary , this is rehash . save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation , you do n't need to read hundreds of pages to do it , or spend $ on what to imagine	0

these are not your typical teens . they love broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage . so here they are at " camp ovation " honing their skills . one of the teachers is a song songwriter . because he is also a " one hit wonder " he 's an angry alcoholic . the other characters ( teenagers ) are a " fag hag " , a cross dresser , a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut , a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem . there is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie . if you like musicals , you will proberly like this but might bore most people .	2
do n't be fooled by the similar-sounding , inarticulate reviews- -this product is not what you think it is . it contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation . the " energy fields " described have nothing to do with actual energy / electricity- -they might as well use the word " aura " for all of the logical sense it makes . in the words of a company representative : the tingler is not battery operated there is no button . that would be our sqwiggler which has 2 aa batteries located in the handle . you 're welcome to return the tingler for a sqwiggler . the sqwiggler is $29.95 please call 800-978-8765 and we can get your credit card information and charge the amount difference of $9.95 plus $8.45 for the shipping fees . make your own judgement , but do n't expect to be as wowed or thrilled as the company claims you 'll be	3
please careful about this grooming kit . i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work . this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not . this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair . also this can not be used for continuous use , if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	3
you can breeze through this book in under an hour - - i just did . while it makes for a suspenseful , albeit entertaining , account of what happened that infamous night , damore relies too heavily on witnesses ' accounts and police remarks ( often little more than kennedy bashing ) . by now , most of us can accept the facts : that emk drank way too much and drove off a bridge , subsequently leading to tragedy . dui accidents happen every day , chillingly often to average people . the fact that this happened to one of the greatest senators in the history of the united states only reaffirms this . ..	0

i have been waiting for this dvd to come out for a very long time ! it is a hilarious movie based on a true story about the creation of the bradley war tank . it shows how the promotion system in the military used to push for new war products to be used , even if they were not acceptable for use , and the struggle of one man to do the right thing . you will not stop laughing while watching this movie !	2
if you want to learn about texas music just buy this disc . tom 's love of life and artist 's eye infect every song . the opening number " tonight we ride " is hard to beat . he sang it on david letterman 's show ( paul shaffer played the accordian ! ) . letterman described it as a " song that will make you want to saddle up a horse , ride up to connecticut and rob a liquor store . " me , i just went out and bought some good reposado gold . letterman 's got a point , though - the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other . my other favorites are bucking horse moon , and all this way for a short ride . tom russell is true american artist like woody guthrie or pete seeger , and this is one of his best .	4
the station agent is a touching , yet off the beaten path kind of flick that i found simply endearing to watch . fin ( peter dinklage ) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in new jersey . having a passion for trains , he embraces this as his home . however , he only wishes to be left alone and finds that 's not as easy to do as he would have thought . first , he discovers joe ( bobby cannavale ) who has set up a food truck outside his home . joe is a conversationalist , desperate to talk to anyone and everyone . next fin meets olivia ( patricia clarkson ) , who almost runs him off the road , twice . these three appear to have nothing in common , and despite all odds , they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see . all three actors gave amazing performances . dinklage , as always , commands every scene he is in . i 've missed seeing him since the bastards at cbs quashed threshold , so it was nice to see something with him in it again . cannavale amused me with his character , joe , who really needed to " get a life . " the idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least . and clarkson radiated as olivia , a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her . what i liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through fin 's eyes . there were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average . plus , there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier did n't even see that he was standing there , so she did n't ring him up until he could get her attention . it just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically . all in all , excellent film	2
you 've got to be kidding me . there is no english translation , just pictures and mandarin phrases . how are people suppose to figure it out without a straight forward english definitions or explanation for each phrase ? they 're suppose to be teaching mandarin to an english speaker , not some boy raised by wolves who never knew any language . this is retarded . worst product ever .	5

i have not heard of or listened to , this cd series , but from the sound of it , its all bad interpretations of popular music . i just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff.. . play classical music . play stuff without lyrics . play a show on tv where the characters sing . do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place . censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song . there are just some songs that are n't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words . think about this.. . do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ? listen.. . i 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not the way to go . all they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gonna be asking questions . do them and yourself a favor and do n't buy these cds	4
pros : compact and complete , this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop ( gray / blue ) . i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well . construction quality is good ( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel , which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs ) , sturdy enough for its intended purpose . i like the output of the lights- -seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight . cons : only one complaint : the output of the lights could be stronger . requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture	1
a surprisingly tiny book . ( the picture in the upper-left corner is nearly actual size . ) after receiving it , i immediately looked up its dimensions in the description on this page . it says 4.7 x 3.3 x 0.6. i had not noticed that before i ordered it . the book seems much smaller than that . not that that is a problem ; it was just somewhat of a shock to find such a minuscule book when i opened the box . i believe it is intended to be carried with you in your pocket or glove box or the locket around your neck so you 'll have a chance to pick out a few choice topics of conversation before you enter a party or whatever . it certainly is not intended as bathroom reading . for one thing , the pages are much too small for emergency tp use . not that i am complaining , mind you . this is a gem of a book with over 200 interesting bits of trivia listed more or less alphabetically from " the amish " to " zero " . ( this is not to imply that the title of each page has much to do with the text , but who cares - the book is fun . ) each page has its stated " fact " and a follow-up paragraph to expound on the subject . also , there are a number of pages randomly strewn through the book with three " instant personalities " each - little tidbits of info about famous people . ( although , thomas jefferson got his own page , as did alfred hitchcock . ) and unlike another trivia book i purchased recently ( bla bla ) , the information here is actually correct . will and mangesh research their topics , not just publish un-provable " facts " gathered from the internet . use the contents with confidence .	0
i enjoyed this movie a lot . hugh jackman and ashley judd are both very appealing in these roles , and greg kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who 's just so charming that you ca n't resist , even when you know better than to fall for it . ellen barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first	2
the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological / philosophical foundations of the emerging confession . there is value in that . i look forward to reading part two , the liturgical ideas section . the emerging church is keen on praxis , but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom , which i had hoped we were past . here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book , which it might help to know : 1. rollins does not think it 's possible to really " know " much theology with " certainty . " in fact , to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an " idolatrous " view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is . this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans , and because in his view , god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way . the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views . he is very certain of his interpretations of " perceptive thinkers like nietzsche , freud , and marx , " eckhart , augustine , etc.. . and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct . i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really , really , faulty . as i 'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament . so , be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible 's basic content . he is certain that no one should be certain , but him . ok , to be fair , he is not certain if christianity is true , and says so on page 44 , but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity . nor , i guess , should you . with his view of " critique of ideology " how can he be so selective of what he is certain of . this seems like a self-defeating ideology . so strong is his disdain for " knowing " with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all . i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true , but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway . rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer , in my opinion . he says the church is not to be about giving answers , but helping raise in people : questioning . indeed , given his views , how could he provide answers ? this book may look deep . i propose , it is merely muddy . 2. he redefines age old terms . orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes , but how loosely one holds it . certainty of revealed truth is dangerous , misinformed , idolatrous . heresy is now a cute little thing . it has come of age . he says people will think his views undermine christianity . we are to just take him at his word that his views wo n't do so , but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would , i think , see the writing on the wall . 3. he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns . after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns , those like himself , at least , to even understand the gospel . he has not . how can he be a bridge ? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores . christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down , not without mystery , nor without debate , but in a very real and tangible way . he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else . 4. he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them . the problem that is huge , and no one seems to notice , is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps . he considers fundamentalists , and by logical extension many evangelicals , to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term , heresy . i kept thinking , what kind of " fundamentalists " is he so angry at ? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals , making generalizations that are misleading . very unobjective . unkind . very divisive . yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom . i can see his views bringing unity to all religions , but it will never bring unity to christendom . he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom . times have really changed in the past 20 years . he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind . 5. he makes god hopelessly difficult . god wanted , it seems , to speak in a plain brown wrapper...the common language of the people , the dust of humanity , the lowly donkey ride , the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel . rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining " human reason " as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said " i am the truth " into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it . god 's message is simple . it 's clear where it needs to be . it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated . rollins makes it nearly all enigma , hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god , who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it , yet who has been unwilling or incapable , given man 's weaknesses , or his own lack of communication skills , to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly . if , as tickle says , this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium , then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man 's religion , the anything goes religion , and following generations will have to deconstruct today 's extreme and irrational over-reaction to fundamentalism . peter , i can learn some stuff from you , and i 'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission . as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points . your views trouble me . nothing against you personally . forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone . i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more , though , it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor . regardless , if it inspires i 'll come back and add a star . hmmm	0

these glasses should not have the bushnell name on them , which misleads one to think they are good quality . i bought them for my son , and by the time i got around to sending them , i discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in , so the lens was misaligned . it was past the 30-day return date , so i glued the crack and kept them for my own use . they are still not right , but i keep them in my car for occasional use . my advice - - spend some extra money and get a good pair .	1
i knew the government was a little crooked...but when i read this....well...lets just say i dont trust the government anymore . its a very great book , and fills you in on some information that you might have missed	0
this scope is one of the best gen 1 units on the market . at 36 lines / mm , it has just about the best resolution . most other units only have 24 lines / mm . the illuminator is bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , and has a crisp edge . it could be a bit larger , however , so that it would fill the field of view . note that if you remove the eyepiece or lens , ( to put on the riflescope eyepiece or change the magnification ) you will break the seal and the unit will no longer be waterproof . do n't bother with the ir flashlight . it 's output is actually less than the built-in illuminator and it is far from uniform .	1

every time this movie comes on my husband ( who is english ) and i watch it and laugh our heads off.if you have ever been in an english train station , drinking weak , watery cups of tea out of dirty , cracked cups.smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.and not to be crule , but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.the thought of two stodgy old english people being driven wild by their passion for each other is , well- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - hilarious ! i give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.oh- - - and the music- -- - please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but it is worth watching for a good laugh	2
i am very pleased with the light output . i purchased them to light the inside of my childs playhouse . they really iluminate the inside as bright as a standard light bulb . i purchased a couple of years ago an earlier type lanturn by rayovac and was really pleased with it also .	3
well , i 'm just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the a / v world . i bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up . this is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you do n't have a lot of money to spend on a digital set-up . just buy and extra after market battery or two ( and they 're cheap ) and some inexpensive analogue tape , and start recording away ! after you climb the learning curve , of course . my one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive , and they 're splattered all over the unit . be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing , but once you 've got it down you 'll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays . oh yeah , almost forgot , the microphones are n't stereo but they 're really quite good for an entry level unit	1
this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in new york city . necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them	0

bought these batteries & charger just before going on an overseas trip . i did n't want to be bothered with frequently changing aa batteries , which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use . i was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables . they lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re-charged in only a few hours . a big bonus that i did n't expect : the recharger is compatible with european 240 voltage so i did n't have to use an electric converter !	1

i really enjoy this product , and am sure that voice-recognition will be standard techology for all computers one day . it is very easy to load , set up and use... . everything that i needed was in the box . i speak with a slight accent , and it still works so smoothly . this is an invaluable tool for people at risk from carpal tunnel syndrome , for those who have difficulty using a keyboard efficiently , or for avoiding the fatigue of preparing large reports . it is so simple that you can speak out ideas and visualize them in print before deciding what to do next . great for doing e-mail.. . all this and you can continue using the keyboard as you wish . i love it !	5
i work at a nursing home for the elderly and travel my entire lunch break to take my kindergardener to daycare after school and then pick him up with my two year old to go home , and to know that i have this product at my beck and call . wow ! ! i am a owner of this product for 6 months now and i all i can say is i love it. . so what is requires special water a gallon lasts me for two months so i do n't mind spending $.75 every two months . i use it in conjunction with my pore cleanser from panasonic and i now i use less make up than ever . i normally wear foundation , pressed powder and loose . now it is just pressed powder . it allows my natural glow to come out and minimized my pores . i do my facial with a towel over my head to intensify the treatment along with a favorite cd and i am on a fifteen minute vacation without leaving home . i take the towel off and my pores are ready for the final stage . i turn on the cool mist and apply a moisturizer at the last minute and i am ready to face another day .	3

this is another superbly done documentary from the award winning pbs investigative journalism series frontline ( peabody award , emmy and many more ! ) . disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation . he 's obviously smoking something , because this is made and hosted by hedrick smith , a pulitzer prize winning journalist who used to write for the ny times . he is one of america 's most respected journalists . i started watching the show since i was in high school ( i 'm now late 20 's ) and their shows are exceptionally high quality . now , if frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by walmart , how is this pro-walmart ? the story starts in america and its impact on the us economy . he interviews some professors , economists , managers , suppliers , and executives . then the story moves to china and hk , and then back to the us . there are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in american culture and business history . is walmart good for america ? i ca n't answer that and neither can frontline . this documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle . it asks some thought provoking questions . the us trade deficit is getting worse every day . quality is going up ( some " made in china " stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year ) , and that 's really scary for us in america . who 's the blame ? well , all of us . we 're not competing well in the global economy , and we want the cheapest goods . we 're not willing to put our money where our mouth is . if you 're interested in economics , history , social issues , this is a must see . if you care about the american economy , and global events , you should watch this documentary . it 's loads better than the " walmart , the high cost of low prices " film ( which is very one sided and not nearly as well done ) . oh , .. and start learning chinese	2
i thought.. . what the heck , i 'll watch it . so i did . i loved it . i was so surprised none of the critics liked it . it was well made and the characters are all rather believable . i was surprised at how many bad reviews it got . i thought it was rather good	2
this mix starts off heavy , and never lets up , with the quirky , yet hard hitting vocal track grace ( anxiety ) by troy pierce ( as louderbach ) starting things off in a very energetic way . this track worked well in sascha funke 's boogy bytes 2 mix , but it was deep into the mix . i feel it 's even more effective starting a mix off . things quickly lighten up with the bloopy claude vonstroke next , and then it 's into the m.a.n.d.y. remix of tiefschwarz 's excellent track damage , featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals . two solid tech house tracks follow , especially touane 's snappy track bassic , and it 's right into the gritty , churning , techno sound of thomas schumacher 's incredible track rotor . the mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7 , which i feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix . it 's not bad , it 's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking . it 's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row , and right after the melodic freefall , it 's into tiefschwarz 's own remix of a depeche mode track . this is the only other slight miss in the mix for me , as i feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes , and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix . another solid melodic track is next , and we end with the dubbed out vocals of kate wax . overall , it 's an exciting tech house mix that 's a full lineup of solid tracks , with not a bad one in sight , and very few dips in the scorching pace of one , very sound , top to bottom mix . do not miss picking this one up , as it 's easily in the top 5 techno / tech house mixes this year	4
i am only an amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera with the long nose gives performance one might expect from an slr film camer costing a lot more , and a lot more complicated to use . i caught the digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty was a simple little canon sureshot 3mp . a great camera , but this camera has the same simplicity , but takes pictures which are much more refined in terms of sharpeness for not much more than i paid for that camera four years ago ! ! this panasonic lumix has a leica lens , which can ' t be matched by any other camera but it 's twin leica camera- -a much more expensive piece of equipment . the long lens might put you off if you are an average family photog , but if you want an all around 35mm-12x camera without a huge heavy expensive bag of lenses , like me , this baby is for you . it only looks massive . it is quite lite and manageable . i use it for bird photographsy , but it could be great for any situation where you need to get really close up in just about any lighting situation with ultra-fine resolution . do n't want to spend mega bucks for a mega-camera ? this is the answer . i love it , and i think your will , too . easy to use , and easy on the wallet . if you 're not quite there , try the next model down , with the same focal length but 6 mp , for a couple hundred less . another terrific buy . no , i do n't work for panasanic . i 'm a retired print editor . jim isha	1
this dvd is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes . first scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record , but the ghost of cab crag is n't too happy about having his record broken . then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what 's with the worm worshipers -i mean they go like whoo " a giant worm is our god , whoo we hate cars " . then they go to the bocephus wrestling facility . could they come up with a better name than bocephus ? there 's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister . the last episode is , by far , the best . a hockey ghost is terrorizing the world cup hockey event . he 's one of the toughest ghosts ever , either that , or the russian police are the biggest whimps ever ! i think this dvd is a good buy if you are a scooby fan , just be prepared , it can get a little goofy . joey	2
jeez , maybe i am getting old , but i really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest . a brilliant scientist . disfigured . angry . finds temporary techie fix for face . goes to get bad guys . fighting . more fighting . still more fighting . ex mate learns he 's alive . he leaves her anyway ( he 's too ugly ) . the end . more to come , if successful . not recommended	2
for those who have watched the movie jaws ( ask yourself , who has n't ) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it . this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly , with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film . the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information , which gives the overall package a nice touch . the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent . a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	4

i am from australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to amazon . is a complete season of baywatch really baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly , the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing ? i do n't think so . not only have the distributors done fans no favours but amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast . on the amazon website as part of advertising for season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it . if you go by the cast that amazon have put on , you would think that it was the real original season 1 , when we know it is not . the release in the uk , which is out now and the upcoming release in australia on march 14th is the real deal . season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct . there are no episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact . might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal . aaro	2

i 'm usually a very skeptical person and i do n't trust too many things that say they will help you do this or that in a short amount of time . but these vitamins actually do work . it takes some time and they are pretty expensive but they work . so if you need something to help your hair grow you should buy these vitamins cause amazingly they do work and will show results . the only thing i hate about the product is the price . but if you have money and want help with growing your hair then you 're in luck . i 'm young and i do n't have alot of money so i ca n't buy these vitamins all the time . but if you have a steady cash flow then you 're in luck and they will totally help you	3
i loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it . this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro . at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie	2
oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through . well gee , if they like it you must too . there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers " guarantee " that this works . after you pay 5-6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening . well it probably is , in your psyche . if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead . ca n't seem to find the " guarantee " on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit	3
i was looking to expand my lens collection without breaking my budget and found this 50mm to be an excellent first choice . i love being able to shoot in low light situations which this lens has allowed for me to do . however , the auto-focus leave a lot to be desired as far as speed and accuracy goes . i 've found leaving it in manual focus allows me to get more shots faster , at least in low light .	1
i first picked up this book because i 've always been interested in what young writers have to say . but i have to admit , even i was a little surprised . this story mind the mythicism , is a real representation of what young children 's minds sometimes go through . that idea of a person you fabricated , gaining more reality than necessary . congrats to ms. oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about . she is one i 'll keep in my mind for a while . if you like young writers , you should check out charles hedji 's fields of discovery . i 'm an avid reader once again	0
okay , i am new to the world of stargazing . i purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at amazon.com . i have been completely satisfied . i am especially impressed with the clear , crisp viewing of the moon . i can see a few planets , but they are of course very small through the eyepiece . i do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope . take your time putting it together . read all the directions first . pay special attention to the details concerning the collimator . if you do n't know what that is , you need to . i almsot made some major mistakes , screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone . if you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions , you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself , especially on a clear night . the package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact . i could n't be happier with my purchase . i am sure a more avid sky-watcher might want a little something more , but for the once-in-a-while gazer , this is the telescope . see ya next review .	1
my subscription for 2006 was up and i needed to renew - since i just reinstalled windows xp professional ( sp2 ) on my laptop ( a dell inspiron 9300 , intel pentium m 2ghz , 512mb ram , 60gb hard disk ) , i decided to simply purchase the 360. i have been having issues with the live update for several weeks now ( error 5 ) . instead i have to download a 15 mb file ever so often with the updated definitions . after checking the technical support website , it appears that norton is aware of the problem and is currently working on it . that was just about two weeks ago . customer support is non-existent it appears since i have yet to be contacted . complete waste of time . renew your existing subscriptions instead . i wish that i had	5
despite early promise , marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self-reflection , this effort fails to deliver on the author 's experience and acumen . the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread , apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa . i had hoped for more , given the fine record in newsprint of this well-traveled journalist .	0
a film that 's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism . since nothing is as it seems , we may as well be inside a fictionalized world ; like the unicorn story the main character , cathryn , is writing . this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding , is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination ; however , the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring . a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem ( hugh is played by rene , rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh . cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn ) . insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind , but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever-changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside . a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action , another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance	2
after reading the reviews here and at [...] on this baby , i was a little cocerned about its low-light and indoor performance . let me be the first to say that my fears were largely unfounded . yes , if you film in very low light , it will darken many colors . but we 're talking 60 lux , which is the roughly equivalent to the light put off from the candles of a birthday cake . just keep the lights on when your kid blows out the candles , and viola ! seriously , i have had absolutely no problems with it filming too dark indoors , outdoors , or even when i film local bands playing in dark bars . the reason i wanted to try this camera was because it is the only flash-based camera that is receiving even mildly positive reviews . i do not want a tape mechanism that will break , nor a fragile hard drive that cannot be used in many film-worthy conditions ( think snow skiing , as the drive mechanism will freeze up on you in very cold weather ) . as i said , i was skeptical when i purchased it , but no more . the videos are far better than any other camcorder i 've owned . my last was a canon zr 50 mini dv , and this camera takes vastly superior videos than that one . the four stars is only because of the mpeg2 format this records to . i have a mac , so editting requires that i convert to dv with streamclip so that imovie can import the movies . mainly , i just do n't edit my home videos so that has n't been a problem . but if would have been nice for it to be an easier option , and it could have been if they encoded to mpeg4 with h264 and mp3 / aac , which appears to be the next standard . if that concerns you , or if you want hd , you might wait until the panasonic sd1 is available because it records in avhdc which is a form of mpeg4. of course , imovie does n't yet support that either , so you may have to wait until ilife 07 to really use it . in parting , i will also mention that the size of this unit is absolutely fabulous . i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera . this thing literally fits in my jacket pocket , so i end up filming a lot more than i did with previous cameras . if you 're looking for small , flash-based , and good quality video , get this camera , you 'll love it	1
i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans , but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here . robin frequently disappears in the sound mix , becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony . that 's fine for a group concert , like the bee gees , but inexcusable for a solo effort . his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act . they should have kept this in the can . it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin . do n't do him the favor	4
a very enjoyable documentary from the personal perspective of an ex christian.we need many such documentaries out there to help inform people about the dangers of religion in general . i wish some brave person would do a film about how christianity came into being from an objective historical perspective . this film touched on the subject , but it was not really the focus of the documentary.perhaps we will be " blessed " by a further exploration of the subject in the future	2
although a couple of reviews said this was a great product , i was wary as i have never found anything that actually worked . i have a job where my mind is always on the go , and often have a week or two a month where i just ca n't get to sleep . the cd arrived during one of these times , i put it on my portable cd player not expecting too much , and almost imediately felt a bit queazy , nothing too bad , and on later research this basically proves the delta wave theory dr. thompson is working . the only time in the past when i have gone to sleep so easily when i have been out partying all night when i was younger . i play the cd on a stereo i have in my room , and i rarely wake up at all . i am certainly going to buy more of his cd 's	4

my two boys , ages 3 and 2 , both pull this book off the shelf over and over . i use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary ( both in english and spanish ) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers ( also in both languages ) , as well as colors . it 's a great addition to the workbook flip flop spanish , and also just for fun. . , my littlest , a one-year-old girl , even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them . they 're sturdy pages , full of all kinds of things . the kind of book you find something new each time you open it . it has little lists to find items as well .	0
the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera ( just like another reviewer ) . i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd . of course , sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month ? since the camera was out of warranty , i knew there was nothing they were going to do . so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products , look elsewhere . i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc. i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !	1

in the chapter about south asia , the authors have written quite a lot about the & quot ; kashmir problem&quot ; but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350 , 000 kashmiri hindus that took place in 1990. i just cannot believe that they do n't know about this	0
being a pc user for many years ( since 1985 ) i have come through all the versions of ms operating systems ( does anyone out there remember 3.5 ! ) ms has also piggy backed this " robust " office product for 20 years . their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar . this is no exception , but this time i like the tool bar ! as to ease of use , i use powerpoint and word often and my spouse uses excel . if there were an easier product available we would buy it but then windows xp would kill it on sight and vista would stop working altogether . why does ms think that everyone but those working in a professional since ( hence office for professionals ) needs all the junk they subject us to ? do those guys in redmond still think adult users of the pc like " cute " things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question ! i am tired of beta testing ms products for so many years but as a pc user i am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system , other than mac , we are all stuck with them .	5
the idea is fantastic . the fact is i do n't wake up immediately like bzzzz- -i 'm awake . amazingly i can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it . on this alarm , the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select . i have mine set for 15 minutes , and usually by the time the light has reached maximum i 'm coherent enough to get up . if the light does n't do it , you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls- -ocean , wind , and ringing bells falling somewhere in between . the flaws : as others have mentioned , the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels . so when it first pops on in the morning , you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp . secondly , you do n't set the alarm for when you want to get up . you have to go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point . then you set the alarm for that earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use the sound in addition to the light , it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity , but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless . a workaround we 've found for this is to use the external speaker provided . plug it into the back of the light , run it across the room , and bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick a sound like " birds " instead of the lip-curling " harbor " or " town " . from it 's buried location across the room , the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out . whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking . fourth , the clock lumination can change colors , rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting . at first that looks cool . until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong . the darkest setting is red , and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color . so yes , it works . and it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but the design is just plain stupid . if the manufacturer would wander by here , read this and make a few design changes , they could make a light worth buying	3

i was surprised to open this pedometer page after sometime and see all the negative reviews it receives . i have been using this specific model for more than 3 months now and i am really satisfied with it . it is really accurate ( & lt ; 1% declination , i have performed more than four tests of more than 400 steps during different times of its life and i have seen a couple of cheap pedometers performing much worse ) , clips firmly to belt or pants , displays the time conveniently and has nice backlight , even has a radio which works , although as most people said , not really its best feature . the truth is that i am not using the radio at all , mostly because i believe the batteries will last longer and it will save me from extra trips to walmart . but i have tested it and it works , although nothing impressive there . of course , for the money , i think you cannot go wrong with this pedometer . one funny comment is that , although most people complain it cannot open very easily , after sometime it will open more easily that you think . actually it has been a couple of times where putting a bag on my shoulders or a waist pouch and applying some pressure on it by mistake , will open it wide , so it does not count any steps . but it does not open by itself anyway , needs external force for this to happen , so it does not happen often . all in all , i am sure that the plastic construction and the less than rigorous production testing will result in many pieces that do not function properly and will result in bad reviews . maybe i have been lucky , maybe not , but this has been one of the best and most reliable devices that i carry and use every day . and a great incentive for walking and exercising more	3
this bar is larger that most nutrition or meal replacement bars - that much is true . what is also true is that is contains more fat . what you will notice with the first bite , is that the bar seems somehow " inflated " . there is an emptiness to consistency of the bar . you are not getting the quality nutrition you would get from a myoplex or apex bar . stick with those brands for pure nutrition and far better taste . these metrx bars leave you feeling as though you 've eaten something that was bad for you - like after you eat a dessert , yet these will not be mistaken for desserts	3

therese , lux , mary , bonnie and cecilia make up the five lisbon girls , ages 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17. cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon 's neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word " death " and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school.. . except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip 's request , knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there.. . except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went.. . but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as " follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . " ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as " elizabethtown " which kirsten dunst is also in . but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future	2

jesse , 15 lives in harlem , new york city . he is the only child of a bright couple and his best friend , rise is one of his biggest influences . jesse and rise grew up together . when rise , 17 turns to crime and joins the counts , a local street gang and insists on bringing jesse in with him along with their friend c.j. , jesse starts to reassess their friendship . he sadly realizes that he and rise are traveling down different streets ; the drive-by shooting of their friend bobby , 14 has left the neighborhood shaken . c.j. , a musical prodigy who plays piano in their church also has his sights set on a different path . it is c.j. and jesse , a budding young artist who is quite talented at drawing who realize they have more in common with each other . rise and the counts are in for a count-down ; sadly , drive-bys claim more casualties . the counts were described as being on the tame end of street gangs ; a warring faction called the diablos were responsible for shooting a friend ; killing a cabbie and later , some members of the counts . sidney , a kind and fair police officer takes the boys under his wing . he is respected in the neighborhood and word on the street was that he was a fair man , which he was . when mason , 19 an older member of the counts was busted for homicide , it was sidney who took rise and jesse to the jail ( " iron city " ) to see the fate in store for their former friend . more problems crop up in the neighborhood ; rise , seeing a chance to leave harlem wants to call jesse and the counts together for a final goodbye . sadly , that goodbye really was the end . this is an excellent book that reflects the city and street culture well . the characters are fresh , cutting edge , serious and believable . the drawings were excellent and a bonus to this book . jesse , an aspiring cartoonist created two west indian charcters , a wise man and a bird . the bird was a metaphor for jesse and it is through this avian character that he asks questions in his drawings that wise answers . myers has written many excellent books , but i think he really outdid himself with this one	0
i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong . this cd is not remastered . i baught this cd because of that review and got burned . the cd even says right on it aad . in other words analog recording / analog master / digital playback . i will say this much though , the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own . however , if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the " all time greatest hits / original recording remasterd " cd from mca . it also has move over from this cd , i love this cd and want it remastered . if you gotta have this album ( i do ) than this version sounds better than the mca version	4
i do n't own a copy of the original cut , and it 's been a while since i 've seen the original cut . a short review of this version is as follows . the film print is flawless in the sense it looks like it was shot in the 70 's or 80 's on purpose . the blue filter is gone , so it does n't look slick and shiny . this film is dark , rich , and grungy . very " noir-ish " , and warm . obviously the running gag through out the first film was that porter wants his 70k back.. . not 130k or 1 million , just 70k . this was maybe mentioned 3 or 4 times and that was it . the first cut seemed like it was being used more for comedy relief over and over and over again . porter in this film is not charming or smooth . he 's smart , violent , and cold . a true anti-hero . the annoying voice over narration is gone . there are several new characters , and several new brutal kills . minus the credits , this film comes in at a brisk 1 hr and 25 minutes . this is a great companion piece to the great " to live and die in l.a. " it got the same mood . i told you this review was going to be short .	2
well at least , some stuff is cool , free cam bag , the pics come out excellent . the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard . also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam . the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining . the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to " freeze up " . bottom line...i recommend at least researching other brands of mini-tapeless cams...but this one...isnt worth 159 or whatever . its trash . go for something else	1
the first epilator that i used was the epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's . i did not use this for long... . a tool of complete torture ! i finally got brave enough to give epilators a try again and got one from " veet " which has a single roller of tweezers but it did such a good job that i was completely hooked on using an epilator . good-bye razors and wax ! i figured that if a single roller did a good job that the conair which had two rollers would do even better . the conair does a good job and i 'm keeping it as my spare , but the epilator from veet actually does a better job . i no longer have any discomfort from the epilators and i even do my bikini area and underarms . i love the results on my underarms and the money saved on waxing . once you see and feel the results you will be completely won over . update : i 've had more time to use the conair epilator and now i 've actually been using it more than my " veet " . just give yourself time to adjust to this epilator and you will be very happy with it . as a matter of fact i am ordering one as a gift for one of my friends	3

it seems to me there 's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era . i 'm not arguing it 's either better or worse than others , it just feels different and very distinctive . in this light , " wall street " reminded me vividly of " no way out " for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several de palma films . do n't ask me why . it just does . useless considerations apart , " wall street " , directed by always controversial oliver stone , pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away . they always burn out , in a snap of fingers . and bigger they are , harder they fall , right ? the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen , featuring a bright young " sport " , bud fox ( played by charlie sheen ) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life . he wants more , and hotshot gordon gekko ( michael douglas ) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful , vicious , influential and a sure winner . by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence , bud sneaks into gekko 's office and tries to prove his value to him . from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young protegé who rises to the top at breakneck speed until , unexpectedly , something shatters his bond to the master . something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs . what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie , so i 'll let that for you to find out if you did n't see it yet . all the acting is quite superb , especially the relationship between gekko and fox . martin sheen - who is charlie sheen 's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work , not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down . he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he 's on screen a couple of minutes at a time . if you like high finance intrigue , big guys pulling the strings on each other , twists and turns , then " wall street " is probably essential . and it will probably give you an excuse to read sun tzu 's " the art of war "	2
not worth the money spent on it . after reviewing info on my new digital camera i followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on aa batteries . i did not need the camera case that came with this kit , and it really had too many pockets for my liking . the batteries did not hold a charge . i only got a few pictures taken before they went dead . if the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead . at least i got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones . i would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots . i have had no experience with rechargables before so i do not know if this is common . but i returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge	1
after hearing about this product and reading the reviews , decided to get one for our newborn baby . the problem however , is that this does not cover the entire room even on its " high " setting . over the course of an hour , i would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room ( 12 x 12 ) . i put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting . i 've only had this product for a month so i will have to follow-up on durability . first month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room . if it were a bit stronger , would give a better rating . i feel like i will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner , or buy 3 of these ( not practical )	3
there 's no question that paying $100 or more will get you a better monopod . but for $16 the sima smp-1 is a tremendous value . i have a sony dsc-w5 digital camera and have done everything i can think of to reduce camera-shake in low-light photos . this monopod has been great for adding stability and making my photos less blurry . the key is that it is small enough and light enough that i can take it almost wherever i go . and because it 's so small , i can bring it in to places that would frown upon a tripod . a monopod is not a total replacement for a tripod . but this monopod is now the only addition to my camera that i take on trips	1
we canoe / kayak down various rivers and creeks . i wanted a way to take my $1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it . the sports pack is completely water proof ( up to 7m ) . i 've submersed the case in a test and in a real-life situation and the camera stayed dry . the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality . it is relatively simple to operate and assemble . you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case , so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used . my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area . so far i have n't had any problems but i 've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs . all told , i 'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case	1

i was wrong . ok , i 've admitted it . i always thought science fiction or futuristic type novels were n't my cup of tea . while reading conspiracy in death i realized i could n't have been more wrong - i love this futuristic series ! a homeless man is murdered and the case is assigned to eve dallas , since it 's not a random act of violence . this man , snooks , died when his heart was surgically removed by what appeared to be a very skilled surgeon . when dallas digs a bit further , she discovers that this crime is connected to another committed in new york city where an aged lc ( licensed companion ) died as the result of her liver being removed . after even more digging , dallas discovers a case in chicago and one abroad that were all similar . these were not the result of black market organ sales since all of the victims were within a few months of dying . in order for eve dallas to find the murderer she had to figure out why these victims were chosen . the closer she got to that answer , the more nervous very influential politicians and doctors became . when she got too close to the truth , the villain had to put a stop to her investigation . the best way to get dallas off the case was to have her suspended from the police department . this was a simple procedure since there was a conflict between the patrol officer who discovered snook 's body and dallas . when that patrolwoman was brutally murdered suspicion fell on dallas . stripped of her badge and weapon , the very items that have been the heart and sole of her during her adult life , she has to deal with not only the idea of not being a police detective , but also with trying to solve this crime having her hands tied . the main plot was interesting but the villain was predictable and no surprise . there was excellent character development and as usual j.d. robb ( aka nora roberts ) draws the reader into the suspense to the point of not being able to put down the book . what makes this book above average and falling into the excellent range is the fantastic subplot of eve dallas being stripped of her identity as a policewoman and how she must deal with the various facets of that . at times , it was more intense and more exciting that the main plot . this is definitely one to read , as all of the " in death " series books have been . start with the first book when reading because j.d. robb always has a couple of instances where she reflects on previous happenings . or you can start with the first book just because it 's the beginning of an excellent adventure !	0

my husband and i are both history and literature buffs , so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to dvd . we are n't typically hard people to please , but this film was one of the most boring movies that i 've seen to date . it 's not that i do n't appreciate artistic , visually stimulating movies - that have a point . perhaps , assuming we all knew the story already , the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass , water , trees...and more trees . apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever ( though i will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there ) , this movie represents revisionist history at its worst . here we are presented with an idyllic , practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the noble savage juxtaposed against the muddy , disgusting , conniving white man . perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some native american life like scalping , or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs . it 's fair to say , as the post-colonial talk goes , that native americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years . but by shifting to the other extreme , do n't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction	2

this lens hood designed specificaly for the coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory . it does more than just protecting the lens , which it certainly does , esp . for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid . ( do n't forget murphy 's law . ) but the lens hood can also improve your picture quality . as with slr lenses , the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture . this is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused ( scattered ) . just use this all the time ( see exception below ) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best ( all other factors being equal , of course ) . the only times you should *not* use the hood is when you use the built-in flash on the 5700 , esp . indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source . the hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject . even outdoors when you use the built-in flash for fill-in light , you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure . get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera	1
and now a word from david lynch , as spoken by dean stockwell as doctor yueh in dune : " the tooth . the tooooootttttttth . remember the tooth . " seriously , my daughter loves dora the explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes . i bought this dora the explorer battery powered electric toothbrush , and she does . game . set . match . best money i ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction . when i tested this model on my finger , i was surprised at how powerful it was for a child-sized unit . this electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull , but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing . battery life is okay , i estimate it costs about ½ a cent for her to brush her teeth each time . the future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills i 'd otherwise have , so this is a money saving unit . if your child in a member of the dora cultus , this is one of the better items to own	3
generally , my eyes glaze over as i reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious . make your own luck by shapiro and stevenson has broken the pattern . written in punchy conversational style , the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making . the process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects , allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure . this sounds as if it could be tedious , but it 's not . the authors know you are not sitting in a policy course . they know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet . the book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus . in managing investments , i 'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors . the tools in make your own luck , such as the prediction map , are completely applicable to the inferential analysis i use in managing investments as well as life 's major problems , such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party . this book is a good read . shapiro and stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the metropolitan museum of art. make your own luck makes you laugh , makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot .	0
sept 15th , 2005 i bought this for my god-daughter after buying mia 's science adventure . i have never been so impressed with a companies product before . you can learn both spanish and french on the same cd . the graphics are amazing , the adventure is stupendous and now lily ( my god-daughter ) is learning spanish . her level is above all her classmates and she 's even started conversing with a mexican girl in our neighbourhood . well worth your money	5
in seeking to develop my own grant writing course , i reviewed 20 books on amazon . i was sold on this one by its extremely high amazon.com sales rank...probably the highest of this category . nevertheless , i was shocked and taken aback by a comment on the introduction page , that harkened back to my eighth-grader days : " you 'll learn that in grant writing you especially need to cultivate two abilities : meeting deadlines and following directions . " despite the obvious comprehensiveness of the materials presented in the book from ms burke-smith 's experience , i do n't know who 's responsible for the talking-down attitude presented here . this is my first everything title , and i do n't know if all everything titles are like this , or if it 's from award-winning business writer ms tremore . all i know is after getting such an introduction , what reader would wish to proceed into the book 's depths with that kind of attitude by one 's hoped-for mentors ?	0
i was doing the new change series and felt something was n't right.found out on the internet it 's a cult all the way.this book is the mildest of all her teachings.let me tell you if you do n't do it her way you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.it 's all so subtle when you sit there week after week and watch the dvd 's it 's all about her and her son and so subtle remnant fellowship the only called out ones.you 'd better get in the arch or you are not the true followers of the lord.well gwen we are saved by grace through faith , it 's a gift from god , not of works so no one can boast ! that 's all she does is boast how sinless or tries to be sinless she is and her perfect remnant.i have been talking to several people that she has judge and judged hard and it makes me sick ! just look up on the internet type in gwen shamblin and you will judge for yourself what this weighdown teaching is all about.judge not least you be judge and why do you look at the speak in your brothers eye when all the time you have a log in your own eye ? i never heard anything about god 's grace it 's all twisted scripture.there 's fruit all right in these peoples lives well other cults have fruit too ! and the really overweight people if they are totally honest with you they starved themselves to get the rest of their weight off.just beware ! !	0
i received " aerial " last december , and it still amazes me . the music soars and sweeps , carrying the listener along on its wings . it is a work of genius , and those who are long-time kate bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive ! this two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences , in my opinion . the first disc , " a sea of honey " is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces , first of which is " king of the mountain , " probably the most " commercially appealing " song on the album . " king of the mountain " sucks the listener in with deep , murky tones and kate 's voice easing into the song softly , building in intensity as the song progresses . " king of the mountain " is followed by songs like " pi " ( who else but kate bush could make the derivation of pi sound so sexy ? ) and " bertie , " a lovely elizabethan paean to her young son . then there are emotionally raw songs like " mrs. bartolozzi " and " a coral room , " the latter of which is about kate 's late mother . the reclusive ms. bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in " how to be invisible , " and sings in reference to joan of arc in " joanni . " after being captivated by songs about famous people , and more down-to-earth personal struggles / triumphs , the listener comes to the second disc , titled " a sky of honey . " this is , in my opinion , the piï¿½ce de rï¿½sistance of " aerial . " this disc is a continuous journey of sound , taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by- -among other things- -the sounds of birds , the sound of her child 's voice , and kate bush 's silky voice singing in italian . the disc is almost indescribably beautiful , in my opinion . i love the way " a sky of honey " takes me out of myself when i hear it . i feel like i am flying at points ; becoming one with the soaring birds . my personal favorite on " a sky of honey " is " nocturn , " a surreal nighttime romp on the beach , accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of kate bush 's voice . the disc 's final ( and title ) track " aerial " is a forceful climax to the sonic journey , and ends with bush singing : " i want to be up on the roof i 've gotta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun " it is as though kate bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip . what an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is ! to kate bush fans , i cannot recommend this album highly enough . true , it was a very long wait for this new cd , but , ms. bush has rewarded her fans duly ; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph ! if you are a kate bush devotee , you will not be disappointed ! and , if you are new to kate bush , " aerial " will be a great introduction to her genius . kate bush is like no other artist i can name . her voice is incredibly versatile ; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee , a temptress or a child . and , so far in her career , it kate bush 's voice gets better with the passing of time . like a fine wine , one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly . " aerial " is well , well worth listening to , and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is .	4
i could not force myself to watch this film in its entirety . i think i made it about 45 minutes in . despite many fine actors , esp . the always interesting jeff bridges , who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles , i simply could not connect and did not care about these people . it was this huge budget american movie shorthand : we 're supposed to care because we 've been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else , but it just does n't work for me . if i do n't care this far into the movie , it just wo n't happen . visually beautiful , and sky high production values on costumes and sets , it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling . whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces , which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of , but why do n't we get faces like that in the major characters . of course chris cooper has that kind of face , but many others ( esp . all the " size 2 women " in the supporting roles ) seem to have stepped out of a commercial . the chicago tribune called this film " sleek and beautiful . " i will completely agree with that , but so are music videos . i kept asking myself , what is wrong , what is misfiring ? i really wanted to like it . some of it is the short-hand story telling , but the look was almost too pretty . when the cinematography is this gorgeous , you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper , or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series . ultimately , i began wondering if the original length was much longer , and it was cut down so much that it became fractured , and if that is the case , my apologies to the director . this is the kind of film that makes me ponder , what is it that european film-makers " get " that we lose in our big budget studio films ? is the system itself hurting some films , by sanitizing and conforming them , when they need to stick out like an unruly horse 's nose at the starting gate ? very beautiful , but no connection , and not satisfying.. . well , that 's a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell , is n't it ? there are lots of special features on this dvd , but if i ca n't sit through the film , i do n't care about the extras . so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it ! i hear the book is something wonderful.. .	2
hollywood make them , then they break them - - stars can fall as fast as they rise . sometimes they rise again , and sometimes they disappear . and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in " the big picture , " a quirky , cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of . it has a few awkward stretches , but overall it 's a darkly witty cult comedy ( " you 're tracking failure all over my carpet ! " ) . nick chapman ( kevin bacon ) is the winner at an arty student movie competition , and instantly agents are chasing him all over l.a. in no time , he 's the rising young director , with a movie deal at a major movie corporation . but he 's also starting to lose sight of his old life , as he tries to become a major success . he changes the style , plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics , turning it into a beach bums / naked ghost movie . he dumps his pretty girlfriend ( emily longstreth ) for a bimbo actress ( teri hatcher ) . when the studio head gets dropped , nick falls as quickly as he rose . but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance - - an arty music video . this time , can he get it right ? christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries , tackling everything from small-town musicals to folk festivals . his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz . but his talents are just as present in a " typical " movie , and guest does a smart , quirky job of it . the lesson : be true to yourself and your art , do n't fall for empty glitz , and do n't let success go to your head if you 're lucky enough to get it . the story is a pretty straightforward one - - nick gets great success , it goes to his head , he falls , and he rises again a wiser man . and the movie falls into straightforward lines , without many unpredictable plot twists . at first glance , it does n't seem that unusual . what makes it special ? well , simply put , guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit , like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick 's life . not to mention the glorious dialogue . when speaking of nick 's one'n'only music video , a studio woman announces , " it 's the best one yet , and i 've seen ' em all ! " and guest manages to show us agents , artists , students , directors and actors , but never descended to cliches . they 're real people , no matter how nasty . and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is . his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet , where he confesses , " i wanna be your friend again . " and he 's backed by good performances by longstreth , michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh . " big picture " treads where many movies have gone before , but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video . a must-see	2
janet browne 's far-reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th century 's most controversial biologist / geologist . the first volume of a two-volume set , " voyaging " , begins ( as you would expect ) with his youth in the english town of shrewsbury under his father 's care . we meet his father - a doctor and businessman , his brother - intelligent but unfocused , and his late grandfather erasmus darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views . from his early days , browne depicts a darwin struggling to find himself , first as a medical student in edinburgh , then as a student of theology in cambridge . though we know better what darwin is to be , browne 's portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options . but the story often returns to darwin 's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis-steps at life . he is seen as a frequent hunter , and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles . despite this , and despite the benefit of hindsight , at times i felt some tension - finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for . we finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard the beagle , a vessel bound for south america on a surveying mission . i wo n't spoil the rest , other than to say that browne does an excellent job of building darwin , showing in detail each moment of discovery upon which the next is laid , capturing his excitement about the natural world as he slowly sheds his amateur standing and gains confidence - finally attaining acknowledged scientific stature . and yet even then , darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world , privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed victorian society . in tenor , it 's clear that browne , a professor in the history of biology greatly respects her subject . but she does not allow him to pass through her pen unscathed . darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station , and held certain prejudices that the author does n't hesitate to point out - such as his not wholly humanitarian attitudes about slavery . she also reveals what some may find darwin 's less endearing traits such as his anti-social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science ( when approaching the subject of marriage , darwin 's priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who , he feared , might place demands on his time ) . she does seem to soft-pedal darwin 's poor treatment of his companions on the beagle , many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage , and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized . ( for those curious , this theme is well-explored in robert wright 's " the moral animal " ) also , it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him , more my failing than the author 's i think , as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on darwin 's life . if you do decide to read it , it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes ( although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book ) . certainly , the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution ( and the legend of charles darwin ) was born . i 've read few biographies better	0
turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item . also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return . it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return . i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return	5

if you burn lots of calories in your activities , this high energy food could give you a lift . there are 250 calories packed into this little 2.4 ounce bar , which is advertised to be at least 70% organic . this bar is advertised to be for athletes first , and as a casual snack second . if you are overweight and trying to drop pounds , you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn . when i opened this bar i noticed that it looks like compressed goop . however , the compressed goop tastes pretty good . the texture is much like a granola bar , though more moist than a granola bar . the black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated . there are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor , which is a big plus . i was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial , which is an even bigger plus . one thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy , but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy . i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process . in either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product . the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts . this bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar . there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements , which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing . clif bars could be a casual snack , but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities . if you fall into that category , which could include hiking , climbing , bicycling , running , jogging , and other similarly strenuous activities , then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package . enjoy !	3
i had read a lot of reviews ( here and elsewhere ) warning of final cut 's massive learning curve , and i do believe that helped soften the blow when i first tried this program . because there definitely is a learning curve- -this is far more complex than imovie . but , the good news is , it 's not beyond the newbie 's reach ! i 'm such a newbie with anything video , it 's pitiful . i have only made two or three small movies in imovie , and they were n't very sophisticated . i mostly just tinkered around . but , being the fool that i am , i decided that i wanted to get final cut express to go along with the new camcorder i had just purchased . because i was prepared to have to re-learn ( or struggle ) at first with final cut , i had purchased a book ( for version 2 of fce , which was perfectly suitable ) . armed with my book and limited expectations , i set about trying to make a fun little " music video " ( using video clips and still pictures ) . amazingly enough , i learned how to do the " ken burns effect " with the pictures , make transitions from one clip to the next , edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video , then fade out for other parts . and i was able to fix the video clips ( zoom in , lighten , change aspect ratio ) . and then i added titles with livetext . all this in the first two days of using final cut ! sure , the little video i made was no award-winner , but it was actually a servicable , fun little project that i was n't too ashamed to show my friends . ( another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips- -there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that i tried with it . i had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions , but something always went wrong . either the picture quality degraded terribly , or else the corrected dimensions did n't " stick " and it bounced back to being distorted . nothing worked- -until final cut . i 'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing , but i tried so many , and failed . so that was another thing that impressed me ! ) i know there 's a whole lot more to learn about final cut , and i certainly do n't anticipate that i 'll become a master at it . but it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than imovie , and it is definitely a lot of fun . the right way to approach it is , i believe , to start small , expect baby steps at first , have fun , and get a book ! a book is absolutely essential . if you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day , this is not the application for you . because you learn to " do it manually , " you have much more control- -but it takes time to learn it all . oh , a note about hardware : i made my first little video on a 1.25 ghz g4 mac mini with 512 megs of ram . it was n't a speed demon by any means , but because my video was short ( about 2 minutes ) , it really was n't too painfully slow most of the time ( except for rendering , but i guess that was going to be slow anyway ) . i have since upgraded the mini to 1 gb of ram , and *everything* is snappier , so i highly recommend it . but it 's good to know that even a little mac mini with less-than-impressive ram can work in fce .	5
after getting and reading primary target as a gift , i immediately began picking up other joe weber books . defcon one , his first , was absolutely terrific . great plot line and characters . the action is continuous throughout . my suggestion is not to pick up this book to read up before going to bed because you 'll never put it down . looking forward to reading his next - shadow flight . my hat 's off to joe weber . keep up the great work	0
i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron . i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w / o the wet on / off feature over this one . it does n't clamp down well on my hair ( i 've got thick frizzy hair ) . the results for me are n't that great , it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy . it 's lightweight which is nice . i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair . i definitely prefer other models over this one .	3
i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months . after about 2-3 weeks of use , the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the " off " position ; the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off . the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks . i definitely do not recommend buying this product	3
when i found " hour game " in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale , i thought i had hit pay dirt . but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as " the winner " and " absolute power " could turn out such a dog . long , boring , and confusing . i fear that mr. baldacci hired an " aspiring young writer " to " help " him crank out a quick book . i cannot pass this book along to my friends - - i could n't do that to them . it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin . what a waste . what a shame .	0
if you 're reading this . you want to upgrade , your old computer to windows xp professional edition here are a few things to keep in mind . first thing is , you can download service pack two from windows update . so no need to buy it integrated with xp . these are what i consider the minimum system requirements : 256 mb of ram . i have found is adequate more equals better . 500 mhz or higher will do . 7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot . if you 're running windows millennium edition , or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved . gone are the blue screens of death . frequently asked question : is windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing . so for most users windows home edition is fine . they both are based on the same code and are almost identical . if you 're thinking of upgrading from windows 2000 , i did , because i like the gui interface better . but windows xp is as stable as windows 2000. so it 's your call . the plug-and-play ability of windows xp is totally great ! windows xp will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards , network cards , etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for cds with drivers . i recommend upgrading to windows xp be a professional or home edition . it is a great operating system have some fun and get it done	5
while microsoft tries very hard to make office " think ahead of me , " they almost always seem to get it wrong . the result is a package that consistently annoys me . it is true that one can turn off the " helpful " hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering , however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody 's business . in my opinion , office ' 97 was an excellent package , and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill . as with many people , i use office at work because i have no choice . at home i 've had good luck with staroffice from sun . while not perfect , staroffice has read and created files compatible with microsoft office very consistently in my experience , and it 's a whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant to recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of excel and / or need to use access database frequently .	5
never owned one of these electric jobs before . could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked . hated brushing my teeth before and now i will look forward to the experience . never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point . why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean ? everyone should have one .	3

is larry an actual redneck , or is it all really a joke inside " larry 's " mind ? i sometimes think that dan whitney ( larry 's real name ) knows what he 's doing . i think he is actually making a huge joke out of the rednecks who are totally in love with him . he is openly mocking them , and when they might get a tad uncomfortable , but then he 'll drop a politically incorrect joke into the routine , and they love him again . dan / larry started out as a " normal " comedian ( there 's footage of him on youtube before his larry incarnation ) , and was n't really getting anywhere with that . so he became a redneck , and is a multi-millionare now . but all his redneck fans think of larry as a " regular guy " , despite the fact that larry lives in one of those fancy houses that rednecks think only nycers live in ( for the record , nycers do n't all live in fancy houses . there 's a lot of working class people in nyc who live in regular houses and regular apartments ) . so larry is taking advantage of illiterate , easily amused rednecks . just put on a flannel shirt , fart , wear a confederate flag , and say you hate liberals , then fleece the rednecks ! i do n't think larry really has a redneck mentality ( even though he 's originally from nebraska , so he has some hillbilly cred , so to speak ) . i think he 's just making a ton of money off of easily amused people .	2
i found this product after seeing it lauded on the today show and it appeared to be a great idea . however , i had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the brababy and they were pretty tangled when i later took the bras out . i also have to wonder how a larger bra would work , considering i 'm merely a b cup and it was a tight fit . in theory , i think it 's an excellent idea . in truth , i think it still needs work . additionally , although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer , one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times i 've used them - even drying on gentle cycle . it did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus . i hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue	3
i got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message . i now find out that was a design flaw . anyway , i spent hundreds of dollars on this one , and now , just over a year after i got it , it wo n't hold a battery charge . i loved both cameras while they worked , but i ca n't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so . i 've written to canon tech support . unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge , i 'm moving on to another brand camera	1
i would recommend this to anyone looking for a way to take video and pictures without the hassle of lugging around ( and charging ) two separate gadgets . it takes excellent pictures , just as good if not better than any other digital camera i have seen . i am also very pleased with the video - i found the software very user friendly and video was easy to transfer and edit on my computer . the battery has a good life , i have had no problems having to stop and recharge it . there is a nite mode that compensates ( very well , i think ) for low light video . the camera is easy to carry around ( it is smaller than my 35mm ) and i am having no problems with the functionality - all in all a great idea and easy to use with great pictures and great video	1
i really ca n't understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record . first off , i bought it without hearing anything by them before , but it had been highly recomended to people who like tool and mars volta by amazon ! ! they coul n't have been any more wrong . so , why did i personally find this so painfull ? well , the whole thing in general is quite painfull . first off , the musicians . the whole band sound like studio musicians . no obvious indivuality or anything new to offer . then we get to the vocals . the closest thing i can compare them to are alison moyet or anthony and the johnsons . i do n't mind anthony and the johnsons , but this guys vocals and the music just do n't rock . which is fine . it 's ok not to rock ! but why the hell , being a tool fan and mars volta fan , was i recomended this ? it 's bland , it 's week , and the dubby bass , boring guitar playing / sound.. . weak vocals. . actually , forget it . the whole package . it is just lame	4
this is a very popular book , which is sad because it 's highly biased . she provides evidence , but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story . christian study maybe , christian fact , very loosely	0
this product would be excellent but runs fully 4 " too narrow and 3 " too short . this creates an aprox . 2 " lip around the entire matress . very odd . this short coming disturbs the experience substantially . the laminated back works well . be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine	3
i 'm a former 35mm photographer who 's a little older and not as spry as i once was and i eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more . digital slr 's are pricey and as a friend pointed out i 'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her . she recommended this model and the more i looked at it the more i liked it . it is a fixed lens model , but with a 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to . it has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want . it does macro . and it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised . so far i have n't come across anything that it ca n't do . this is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi-pro who does n't want to go full digital slr yet .	1
i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer . i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well . my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this . great product ! !	3

very good camera . this was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera . she picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit . directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger . takes some getting used to . zoom lense works great and takes good pictures . where the on-off button is so close to the shutter , you have to be careful that you do n't accidentally shut the camera off . she is very satisfied with it .	1
after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out , i was extremely disappointed . the movie very well could be alright on its own merits , but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	2
the product is very good , do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago : the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes . but still , we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes . it 's a good buy	3
i 've had this camera just over a year ( figures ) and it has gone completely bonkers on me . sometimes it works and other times it puts black lines across the screen making it useless . you never know when you turn it on whether it will work or not - - making it completely unreliable . keep in mind that this camera was used almost entirely inside for my business , so it was n't abused , dropped , thrown in the bottom of a purse , etc. it was treated very carefully and probably only shot about 2 , 000 pictures total . frankly , i 'm kind of glad it broke so that i have an excuse to replace it . here 's why : 1. takes beautiful still shots , but forget about any kind of action . it takes too long between shots to get good action . it also blurs nearly all the action shots i 've ever taken , regardless of what mode it 's in . 2. the red-eye is aweful . it should do better . i doubt that i 'll ever buy another canon	1

` ` people say again and again that philosophy does n't really progress ,  that we arestill occupied with the same philosophical problems as were thegreeks.but the people who say this don't  understand why ishas to be so. it is becauseour language has remained the same and keeps seducing us into asking the same questions. as longas there continues to be a verb ' to be'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we stillhavethe adjectives ' identical ' , ' true ' , ' false ' ,  ' possible ' , as long as we continueto talk of a river of time , of an expanseof space , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties and find themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up.and what's more , this satisfies a longing for the transcendent , because , insofar as peoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' ,  theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` ' ' philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of ourintelligence by means of language ` ` ` ` ambition is the death of thought'''  these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophysome70 years ago ( but most people have yet to find this out ) .dennett , though he has been a philosopher for some40 years , is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist , john searle , studied under famous wittgensteinians ( searle with john austin , dennett with gilbert ryle ) but searle got the point and dennett did not . dennett is a hard determinist ( though he trys to sneak reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to ryle , whose famous book ' the concept of mind ' ( 1949 ) continues to be reprinted . that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine . dennett enjoys making the mistakes wittgenstein , ryle ( andmany others since ) have exposed in detail . byaccident , just before this book , i had read ' 'the minds i' ' , which dennett coauthored withdouglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad mistakes ( see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted twofamous articles that pointed the wayout of the mess- --nagel's  ` what is like to be a bat ? ` and an early version of john searle's  chinese room argument explaining why computers do n't think. nagel pointed out that we do noteven know how to recognize whata concept of a bat 's mind would be like. searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize thinking and how itdiffersfrom what a computer does ( eg , it can translate chinese without understanding it ) . likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing what countsas good vs bad- -or just intelligible- - for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our use of the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention , particle ,  thinking ,  determines , wave , cause , happened , event ( and so on endlessly )  are rarely a source of confusion but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy ( and anydiscussion detached from the environment in which language evolved )  chaos reigns. wittgenstein was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid this . unfortunately , he died inhis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of how the mind ( language ) worksand he never wroteany popular books , so understanding of his work is restricted to a very few . searle is one of the world 's leadingphilosophers and has written manyextremely clear and highly regarded articles and books , some of which have pointed out the glaring defects in dennett's work.his review ` ` consciousness explained away' ' of dennetts 1991 book ` ' consciousness explained''  and his book ''the mystery of consciousness' ' are very well known , and show , in a way that isamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither dennett ( nor any of the hundreds of philosophersandscientists who have written on this topic ) havecome closetoexplaining the hard problem- -ie , how do you conceptualizeconsciousness.many suspect we will never be able to conceptualizeany of the reallyimportant things , but it isclear that we are nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly ignored his critics but has favored searle with vituperative personal attacks.searle has been accused by dennett and others of being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is ( mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , . he just points out that we do n't have any idea how this happens . searle characterizes as ' 'intellectualpathology' ' , the views ofdennett andall those who denythe existence of thevery phenomena they setout to explain. dennett repeats his mistakes here andleaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of the book , where we are told that they areall mistaken and it is a waste of spaceto show how !  unsurprisingly , there isnot one reference towittgenstein or searle in theentire book.there arehowever , many references to other old schoolphilosophers who are as confusedas he is. like most people , it does not cross his mindthatthe very inference engineshe thinks with are forcinghim to cometo certainconclusions and that these will oftenbe quite unconnectedwith or wrong about the way things are in the world . they are a jumble of evolutionary curiositieswhich do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survivalhundreds of thousands of years ago.wittgenstein was a pioneerin doingthought experiments in cognitive psychologyand beganto elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtletiesof language in the 30 's , and thus he made the sorts of commentsthat this review begins with. dennett says ( p98 ) that his view is compatibilism , ie , that free will ( whichi hopewe can equate with choice ) is compatible with determinism ( ie , that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future'' --p25 ) . he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however , the whole book is smoke and mirrors by means of which choice , in the sense we normally understand it , disappears and we are left with ` ` choice ` ` , which is something we cannot choose. naturally , this echoes the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ` ` consciousness explained ` ` . it is remarkable that , at a time when we are just beginning to reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a single neuron works ( or how an atom works for that matter ) , that anyone should think they can make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein from the opening quote : ' ' and what's more , this satisfies a longing for thetranscendent , because , insofar aspeoplethinkthey can see ` the limits of human understanding ' , theybelieve of course thatthey can see beyond these . ` ` the relation between language ,  thought and reality is extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very , very careful , some understanding is possible , but dennett throws caution to the winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are at least 3 different topics here ( evolution of our brain , choice and morality ) and dennett tries vainly to weld them together into a coherent account of how freedom evolves from the deterministic crashing of atoms. there is , however , no compelling reason to accept that bouncing atoms ( or his favorite example , the game of life running on a computer ) are isomorphic with reality. he knows that quantum indeterminacy ( or the uncertainty principle ) is a major obstacle to determinism however defined ( and has been taken by many as an escape to freedom ) but dismisses it due to the fact that such events are too rare to bother with. by extension ,  its unlikely that any such event will happen now or even in our whole lifetime in our brain , so we appear to be stuck with a determined brain ( whatever that may be ) . however , the universe is a big place and its been around a long time ( perhaps forever ) and if even one such quantum effect occurs it would seem to throw the whole universe into an indeterminate state. the notion ' 'there is at any instant exactly one physically possible future' ' cannot be true if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur- -in this case there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this recalls one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics- -each instant our universe is branching into infinitely many universes . he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice . this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness ( or any other emergent phenomenon ) . if so , they will definitely win at least one nobel prize , for not only will they have explained consciousness , they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence ( how higher order properties emerge from lower ones ) . so , they would have to solve the ' easy ' problem ( to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty ) and the ' hard ' one ( what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . and while they are at it how about also doing the impossible- -an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain . it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time . but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer . he starts off on the first page appealing to the laws of physics for protection against fantastic notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is made of notions just as fantastic ( uncertainty ,  entanglement , wave / particle duality , schrodinger 's dead / alivecat etc ) and as feynmann said many times ` ` nobody understandsphysics ! ' ' many think nobody ever will . on pg 2 he says our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and on pg 2 to3 that our personality differences are due to how our ' 'robotic teams are put togther , over a lifetime of growth and experience . ` `  this is a bald dismissal of human nature , of the abundant evidence that our differences are to a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early childhood , and is typical of his constant confused wandering back and forth between determinism and environmentalism . on page 9 he notes that free will is a problem and our attitudes to it make a difference , but for whom ?  nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what 's the problem ?  one has to step outside life to experience a problem and then everything becomes a problem. what are consciousness ,  pain ,  yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity etc. ?  i doubt that anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their interactions with people or their decision making processes due to their thinking about choice. this shows that there is something strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are different. there are games for language connected with the cognitive templates for decisions or seeing colors etc , and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit thinking about the past , planning for the future ,  guessing the mental states of others , etc , but if one takes the results in the wrong way and starts to think ` ' john will try to steal my wallet' ' , rather than just imagining that john might do it , confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled mode or distinguish it from coupled mode , enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be seen this way- -they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , notbeing able to see the difference between the motives people have and the motives they might have . one can then see much of the philosophizing people do as operating in these decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them the differences from the normal mode. normal mode- -eg , what is that lion doing- - was undoubtedly the first one evolved and decoupled modes- -what did that lion do last time or what does he intend to do next- -evolved later. this was probably never a problem for animals- -any animal that spent too much time worrying about what might happen would not be very successful contributing to the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed culture and began degeneratinggenetically , could large numbers of people survive with genes that led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes. hence , we have philosophy and this book , which is mostly about running the decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real consequencesexcept earning royalties for putting the results in a book for other people to use to run their engines in decoupled mode . ' let us alter wittgenstein 's quote to read : ' 'as longas there continues to be a verb ' to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as ' to eat ' and ' to drink ' , as long as we continueto talk of freedom of action , of saying i wish i had done otherwise , etc. , etc. , people will keepstumbling over the samepuzzling difficulties andfind themselves staring atsomethingwhich no explanation seems capable of clearing up. ' ' as withmost philosophy books , nearly every page ,  often every paragraph , changes from one type of language game to another without noticing that now one would have to be joking or dreaming or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc , and not actually intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the world. on page 10 he says we count on free will for the whole way of thinking about our lives , like we count on food and water , but who ever , outside philosophy , standing in front of lunch counter full of food , ever thinks how fine it is that they have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral water ?  even if i want to be a serious compatibilist and try thinking this in decoupled mode , i have to exit and enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have happened if i had not had the ability to make a real choice. wittgenstein noted how pretend games are parasitic on real ones ( this is not a trivial observation ! ) . the ability to engage in very complex decoupled scenarios is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say that normally , nobody counts on having choice ,  but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive basics. he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual atmosphere of choice ,  and that ` ' it appears to be a stable and ahistorical construct , as eternal and unchanging as arithmetic , but it is not . ' ' and on page 13- - ''it is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs'' . the whole thrust of cognitive psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning , deciding , promising ,  resenting ,  etc , but that these are built-in functions of the inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously and start running in very early childhood. there is no evidence that they change as we grow , or are in any way subject to our beliefs , only that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests its probable that our having free will depends on our believing we have it ! do we believe we see an apple , feel a pain , are happy ?  the language game of belief is very different from that of knowing. we can believe we have a dollar in our pocket but if we take it out and look at it we ca n't meaningfully then say that we still believe it ( except as a joke etc. ) . the inference engine can run in decoupled ( belief )  mode so we can imagine havingchoices or making them , but in life we just make them and it is only in very odd situations we can say that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is saying thisis the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else- -consciousness ,  seeing , thinking , etc. if we take this seriously ( and he says ' the serious problems of free will ' ) then we are getting into trouble and if we actually try to apply it to life , then madness is minutes away . . on page 65 et seq . , he discusses causation , intention and the ` informal predicates ' that we use to describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has shown that we describe all objects with a limited number of ontological categories which we analyse with our intuitive physics modules and that when agents ( ie animals or people or things like them- -ie , ghosts or gods ) are involved we use our concepts ( engines ) for agency , intuitive psychology , social minds , etc to decide how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module but rather it will involve all of these and other inference engines , depending on the precise situation . discussing possibility and necessity is much easier if one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive physics ,  agency , ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention here of wittgenstein 's many incisive comments on causation , intention , deciding , nor of searle 's now classic works on intention and social reality . he spends much time on ainslie 's book ' breakdown of will ' , in which is discussed the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which we evaluate probable outcomes . hemakes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism , emotion and economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . it was bingham 's idea , amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson ( 1992 ) that cooperation was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches that areobligatory and promising. indeed they are , and in fact they are standard parts of economic , evolutionary and cognitive theory , but unfortunately ,  he makes little reference to the other work in these fields . all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them . he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. onpg 216 he says that making oneself so that one could not have done otherwise is a key innovation in the evolutionary ascent to free will , and that we can only be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive to opportunities . but where this ability resides is not revealed for several chapters !  dennett has a penchant for hiding his ideas in a massive amount of rather irrelevant text. again , he gets things backwards , as there is a vast body of very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and these are not provided by some part of our conscious self , but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the engines. as he notes , hundreds of experiments with the prisoner 's dilemma and related protocols have shown how easy it is to manipulate people 's choices and that their calculations are not conscious and deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to make them conscious , they are much slower and less reliable . so , there has been constant pressure of natural selection to make the engines fast and automatic and inacessible to deliberate thought . dennett says ` we make ourselves ' so that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis of morality and choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly the opposite. our inference engines give us basic moral intuitions and we generally act in accord with the results. if we or others do not we feel guilt , outrage , resentment etc ,  then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.our genes make us so we ca n't ( mostly ) do otherwise , not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it . we can often choose to do otherwise but our own intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved in small groups between 50 , 000 and some millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to our advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reasonfor the chaos in the world . on pg 225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will as ' 'a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look likedecision making ( from certain angles ) ' ' . he claims that thisplays all the valuable roles of free will but lacks some ( unspecified )  properties possessed by traditional free will. the smoke is thick but i am pretty sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand aschoice. he insists ( top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic account of decision making leaves plenty of room for moral responsibility , but making ourselves so we could n't do otherwise does not seem to describe the way we actually function ,  nor does it seem to leave any room for morality , as that would seem to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise . he does not propose any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary or forced and i doubt he could do so. normally if someone asks us to move our hand , we know what counts as having a choice ,  but , typical of philosophers ,  i expect that regardless of whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position . at this point he also starts his discussion of libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time . on page 253 et seq . , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will- -the ' 'brains user illusion of itself'' ' which has as one of its main roles providing ' 'me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times ` ` . and ` ` illusory or not , conscious will is the persons guide to his or her own moral responsibility for action . ` `  he says the trick we need is to see that ` ` i ` '  control what is happening inside the ' 'simplification barrier'' ... ' 'where decision making happens'' . ` ` mental events' ' become conscious by ' 'entering into memory'' . ' 'the process of self description... is what we are'' . the crucial thing is that choice is possible because the self is distributed over space ( the brain ) and time ( memories ) . he realizes this is going to leave many incredulous ( everyone who can follow this and really understands ! ) . ' 'i know that many people find it hard to graspthis idea or take it seriously. it seems to them to be a trickwith mirrors ,  some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisksconsciousness , and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to be introduced . ''  many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but i would say it 's incoherent and thateverythingwe know about consciousness and the whole universe ( making the obvious extensions of such claims ) was gone long beforewegot this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals ! this is a stunning denial of human nature ( ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote ' darwin 's dangerous idea' ' ! presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space ( the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness ( line 6 from bottom ) . he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain ( you will have to suffer through ' consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either ) . though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades ( social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts . if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , thats ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes . we are also told here that r&d ( by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality . i am sure that he will get little agreement on this . it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates ( and earlier ) long before spoken language ( though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) . he continues ` ` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago ` ` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake ! and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect ) thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes . on pg 260 he claims that because we do not comprehend our ' 'bland dispositions to cooperate' ' ,  they mean nothing to us , but it is the operation of our templates that is everything to us. there is ample evidence that if one of them is damaged a person cannot function properly as a social being ( eg , autism ) . i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think . he also says here that it was one of the major evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology . i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions , like all the templates , are accessible to consciousness . we may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating ( ie , we cannot change the engine ) . i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings . another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or ' moral type ` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer . on pg 267 he says that we now replace our ` free floating rationales ' ( probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . and on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing - -demanding and giving reasons- - that affects moral reasoning . again , he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research- -the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing . we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility . it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition . on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education ( memory ) and sharing . it 's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ' ought'and ' is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago- -ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people . he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes ( eg see ' the blank slate ' ) . he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion . this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like ' praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms . on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess ( evolutionarily stable strategy ) can produce morality . his idea here is that genetic ` r&d ` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture ( memetics ) produces variations and clarifications . i would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases . culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings . the last part of the book is mostly concerned with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart and honore , which i started reading 30 years ago since it 's authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein. dennett tells us that we have control over our own morality and that thinking about morality will improve us. but , there seems no justification whatever for this view in this book . there is nothing at all here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that has no connection with philosophy - and there is not a hint of spirituality in this entire book- -another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find more wisdom about how to be free and moral in any of osho 's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy . one rarely finds spiritually and morally advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here , nor in anything he has done , that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them . it seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . so , how much opportunity is there to improve our morality ?  it seems clear ( eg , see pinker 's ` the blank slate ` ) that most of our behaviour is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . on average , maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior ( variations are the only thing we can study ) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter most today are those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect . how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is . and if one did , we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc. but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking , coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is ! and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first . to return to the quote at the beginning- - 'ambition is the death of thought' . indeed- -though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts	0
although this sports new remastering , unless you have either the golden hits cd available here at amazon and your local cd shop , the now out of print golden celebration boxed set or the 2 volume " patti page collection " series ( volume 2 is also out of print ) , this is unnecessary as it duplicates every track on golden hits except for let me go lover instead of with my eyes wide open i 'm dreaming and the songs are arranged in a different order . fans are better off looking for the 2 previous out of print collections with let me go lover to obtain this track and for the rest of this stuff , either buy golden hits , the boxed set and the 2 volume patti page collection series , and btw , vol . 1 is still in print so you can order it right here at amazon	4
at least if your going to decieve people about the lcd screen in the back , at least make the picture quality decent . i mean this barely qualifies as a picture . some pictures are so bright it just looks like a splash of light . this was sickening to me because my daughter was excited and it broke her heart when i had to return it because she expected to at least be able to see the pictures . definatly stay away from this camera	1
all i have to say is 485 comics for 40 dollars . or about 40 years worth . that 's like a dollar a year . you do the math...it 's an amazing deal . also , quality is great and you can print them if you want	5
i 'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and i ca n't decide among the following : * travels through guilt with the world 's 33rd richest hippie * the mind of an empty suit * a self-important revisionist history * how i learned to hate myself and love the third world * memoirs of a cold war paperpusher confessions of an economic hitman by john perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the cold war by a man who had no stake in his own ambition . the first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world , when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry . if you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy , then the moral outrage of this book makes sense . but there 's a whole lot to swallow . on the plus side , it 's a fast and somewhat entertaining read . otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface . one of the things that i 've had in mind as i was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny . as i look at the 20th century , i think of most of it focused on the economics of . perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation . he falls in love with socialist charismatics in latin america , rues the lives of poor peasants , and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism . perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist . a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric . but you ca n't imagine that he even had the temerity to read marx , weber , engles , friere or anyone . back when i was a bit more blackified , i referred to such people as culture vultures . if it 's indigenous , it 's good . but you 'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics , literacy rates , crime rates or even inflation . i discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the world bank except that he saw it as evil . technically , you 'll get a great deal more insight reading wikipedia . basically , perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet , his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the cia and nsa and that this is , was and always will be the american way . you really get a foggy view of the evil empire of america from perkins , who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game . it 's a confession all right . by the time i got 2 / 3rds of the way through , reading the book began to become annoying . the incredible vacuity of this man was staggering . there are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of . he found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning . it is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory . we learn that he took one of his charges ( female ) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the caribbean , but that when he got there , he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees . if you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance , the best book i 've read is my life as a quant . if you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy , the best book to read is larry kolb 's overworld . if you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the cold war era , then this is your book . but it 's nowhere near as good as , say the quiet american . you can imagine that perkins , who is a great admirer of graham greene , might have had aspirations to be such a character as greene might pen . he is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus , but he is to honest to consider himself heroic , and i suspect that he 'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life . in that regard , ' confessions of an economic hitman ' is ( now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition ) a blueprint for american liberal guilt . if there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom america to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown , it is john perkins . he has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic american , down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of thomas paine . you 'd think , being a pseudo-economist , that he 'd have some room in his heart for alexander hamilton . ahh but that would mean that he 'd have to admire courage . i did n't want to be a harsh judge of perkins . i thought i might learn of an extraordinary life , one of conviction and then epiphany . instead i learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through . someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that ' corporatocray ' is evil . this book has been a disappointment in many ways . i may well be very happy to read thomas friedman after this . good parts ? yeah there are a few . he speaks about a few south american presidents who might have been contenders . he gives a few details about saudi aramco . but compared to larry kolb 's fascinating and detailed portraits of daniel ortega and adnan khashoggi , this is romper room . if perkins thought he was an agent.. . do n't make me laugh	0
this is what you need if you want a suite of protection for you pc . i 've used mcafee . it drove me nuts . i 've used norton . also drove me nuts . zonealarm worked nearly flawlessly ( as well as windows can . ) it is a very stable and intuitive program that is what i have been looking for . all i can is that you should buy this and get rid of whatever you 're using now , especially if it 's mcafee or norton . just a sidenote : i run avg free antivirus alongside this and i also ran it alongside norton and mcafee . avg would catch things that neither norton nor mcafee would . never have had that problem with zonealarm	5
this was a very interesting movie . a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key . i think i liked the skeleton key better.. . but this was still a really good movie . there are a few scenes with nudity in it . not a movie for the youngsters . we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end . a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	2
this is the easiest way i 've ever been able to make cd's . it realy makes photo cd 's easy and produces a great product . a group of frinds and us just got back from mexico and i put all of everyones photos in separate files on a cd . the automatic slide show goes through the differ n't files as if they were just one file with no seperation , but the pictures are still separated in each person 's file for ease when printing and so forth . it 's great , wish i would have had this years ago	5

do n't listen to the whinnier . if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills , this helps . you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money . it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work . i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company . they are helpful as well . i use them at work , at home , and in the car . the brain builder booklet mentions the cd's . if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving , this will help you	5
i 've had this pc remove for 1 year and i have used it everyday that i am home and i have not yet changed the remote batteries . my pc has suddenly become more entertaining and useful . with this remote , the time i spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced . in my 860 sq ft apt , the farthest point away from my pc is about 50 ft . the remote has always worked from anywhere in the apt thru 2 walls . i was surprised to get this much range . i have not yet found a spot from which it does n't work . to get the best range be sure to position the usb rf receiver near the computer as directed . with my pc , i 'm always playing music . i also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the internet . i have a good graphics card with s-video tv out . i got a 50 ft s-video / out cable ; this connects my pc and tv which are in different rooms . with this remote , i now can play ( and control ) my entire digital music collection on my home stereo ( which is connected to the tv ) without being at my pc or be in the same room as my pc . also , with this remote , any video that can be played on my pc , ( online streaming or local ) i can watch and control it ( pause , rewind , slow motion , next , fwd ) on my tv . my pc / tv has effectively become a powerful media center- -media center pc not needed . there is so much more.. . with the remote , i use the mouse from far away ( lying in bed or on the couch ) ; there a numerous ways to get creative with this . i wish the remote was lighted . still , the keys are arranged for " touch typing " so to speak . another negative , i 've noticed that windows media player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote .	5
mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend . this kind of crap could n't even sell a can of coke these days . choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches . i hear scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer - - and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found , but scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie	4

i used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades . i have always cut myself occasionally , but when i cut myself with the fusion power , i got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar ! talk about sharp ! i went back to using it and then a month or so later i cut myself again and this one was even worse . you could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin . i tossed the fusion in the garbage , went back to the 3-blade , and wrote gillette an e-mail to complain , to which they did not respond . i 've read all 60 reviews before mine , and was surprised to see that no one else reported this problem . maybe it 's my shaving technique , but this thing is a weapon	3

if you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback , this is the product to buy . packaging , support , presentation , and hardware / software quality are the best that i have seen . no down side . it 's not a game in the usual sense . more of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way . there is room for a little mischief . instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly , i tried busting a few . type a personality shows through occasionally . i will be purchasing the next item in the series . i am learning to relax , at will , which will be helpful in my high-stress occupation . good luck	3
i wo n't go into a long diatribe . suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year , i was disappointed . i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great . this is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit . there 's a point where baez messes up a song . ( i do n't have anything against baez . that being said , i do n't have much for her either . ) there 's joking and laughing , but really , i do n't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing . you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert . the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them . if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff , you should be pleased with this double-disc . i love dylan , but not enough to enjoy this over and over again . i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix	4
if you do n't like getting attention , these are not for you . i 'm often surprised by people 's astonished reactions to the act of putting them on and taking them off ; i 'm so accustomed to pulling them apart , that i forget how unusual the viewing public finds it . i have been wearing clics for nearly a year . i pretend that i do n't need glasses , but of course i do and have for nearly a decade . popped the standard diopter lenses out , and put in my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite a warning from my optical shop . ( and even if they had broken from the experiment , the price is right : i could try it again . ) previously i was wearing glasses on a chain . besides the various difficulties noted by another reviewer , i also found that the plastic loops that connect the chain to the arms of the glasses have a bad habit of stretching . then the glasses slip off the chain at inappropriate times and the frames break . i call the color of mine " magenta " - which may or may not be the same as the online " red " - i bought them in a shop ( **gasp** ) . my short hair is not a problem , but i agree that reading in bed does n't work . so i use a different pair for those occasions	3

i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars . but after watching it again , i realized i liked it better ( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you ) . i do not consider all of the performances goth . martiya possesion are more tribal than anything ( at least on this video ) and i really dislike the expression , or lack thereof , on their faces while they are dancing . they either look completely bored , pissed off , or smug . i skip right over it . i also did not care for asharah 's dance to the drum solo by solace ( " opaque " ) . the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all . the music is saying " fast , big , upbeat " and she 's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves . and of course , we all love the s&m piece...excuse me , s&m is not part of the goth subculture , and has no place on a bellydance video . jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer , but she did n't dance much on this and i did n't want to see what was on her part . another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music . i like solace and all , but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre . there were a few , but not enough for my liking . my favorites on this video were tempest , ariellah , jeniviva and ayshe ( for wierdness factor ) . for all of its faults , this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose	2
i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit . i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try . the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty . the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp . be carefull with this lens though . the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow . do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp . focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots . the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer . canon , how about a 100mm macro with is ?	1

dirty deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself , " this is idiotic " , but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll . it 's silly . it 's a teenager movie . it 's been done a million times before in hollywood ( most of the time poorly ) . dirty deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you 're perusing cable late one night- -and ca n't find anything else on your 500 channels- -is maybe worth a stop if you 're determined to watch tv instead of just going to bed . but who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers ! just look what 1980 's teeneager movie hollywood knights launched for the likes of michelle pfeiffer , tony danza , robert wuhl and fran drescher . everybody 's got to start somewhere , right ?	2
this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework . writing a book is no small feat , and technical books are a special beast . with that last statement in mind , this is were the book sadly falls short . for one , the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books ' code . the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print . while improvement is always good , this presents two problems . 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material . not a good thing for those trying to learn , as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book . also , and this is not to disparage the authors skill , but i buy books because i am expecting experienced , if not expert advice . if a small , sample application needs rewriting , perhaps they should write about something else ? further down this road , the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling . i suspect that the final build file was not tested , or it was a case of " well , it compiles on my machine " . there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled . thankfully , i use eclipse and imported the project . eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies , which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive . examples are : jakarta-commons / collections , and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access . for an experienced developer , familiar with ant and a good ide , it was not a lot of trouble to get it running , it just did not give me a good impression . bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql : first , no matter what db you swap in , you 'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file . i made property variables which i placed in build.properties . then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it . ) . another great reason to use eclipse . why you must change it , is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you ca n't name a table user	0
we all know the movie and story of the silence of the lambs . i reviewed the movie and gave it a 5 star rating because to me , it is one of the best films ever made . now , with red dragon , i give it 4 stars but i think this is a very good movie and what makes it so good is... . anthony hopkins , the brilliant actor who plays hannibal lecter . i do n't think this movie would have been as good if hopkins would n't have played the role of lecter . i own the original manhunter , which is an older movie and it was good but hopkins can not be beat for the hannibal lecter role . this is a great thriller film ! ! edward norton delivers a very good performance as retired fbi agent will graham . when a series of serial killing style murders start , graham is called out of retirement to help the fbi catch the killer known as " the tooth fairy " . he eventually seeks the aid of lecter to help him find who this killer is . like silence of the lambs , we find graham visiting lecter in his maximum security facility . very cool scenes in this movie with some blood and violence . this movie holds true to the book with the same name . we get to see lecter wearing the famous face mask he wore in s.o.t.l. without going further into all the details of the movie , i 'll just say this is a great prequel although it came after s.o.t.l. and the movie hannibal . also , ralph fiennes delivers a good performance as the red dragon . for anyone who has n't seen this movie , it 's a must see ! ! ! !	2
just wonderful , wonderful ! even if you have n't seen the movie buy the music...so lovely and refreshing...of course , there is no one like van morrison ( always and forever a 5-star ) , he tops the all-time charts for me...kevin kline is so smooth with la mer...and the rest of the music is soulful and enchanting...you just ca n't miss with this one	4
like many of the reviewers here , i am an anne rice fan . however , i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them . i mean , few of the " dracula " movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker 's novel . all i wanted - and expected - was a flashy , no substance guilty pleasure movie , a la " dracula 2000. " that alone should tell you my expectations . but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure . the storyline did n't make a lot of sense when taken on it 's own , and the acting was bad to bland . i also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires . rice 's vampires are supposed to be beautiful , whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house . however , one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat . since the videos are included on the dvd , it earns 1 star	2
mercury contamination is a very big deal especially if you are going to take a product " for life " , are pregnant or a child . many fish oil products have mercury contamination and are not filtered . is this product mercury free ? ? so far the only product that was certified mercury free was available from my medical doctor by a prescription .	3
i would agree with the translator that imitation of christ ranks very close to the bible . i read it over and over . it is shocking clear and concise . it forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim , yes , to be a saint . thomas a kempis 's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over . in the normal state of human depravity , deception , duplicity , relativism , and excuse-making no one could write such a book without a transcendant , almighty , omniscient , omnipresent and infinitely merciful lord . each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our lord more and more . i wait patiently for your return lord jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth	0
i purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer . the document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that i simply had to re-type . it would have taken longer to correct than to re-type . when i talked to textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that i should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities . in other words , they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it . the program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else	5
the ab portion of the dvd is good , although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether . the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set . the last one is a step-type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on , you ca n't do it . the dvd itself is not very professionally done . tamilee miscounts , does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words . abs of steel maybe , buns of steel , no way	2
the other day i used a friend 's standard digital camera for a little while . the whole time i found myself missing the manual zoom , instant response and convient manual buttons on my d50. this camera takes amazing pictures . as an dslr beginner i used the camera in auto mode for the first several weeks , now after reading some books on photography i 'm slowing starting to use the manual features . the d50 lets me choose the level of control that i 'm comfortable with , from full manual to full automatic ; and both options are just a turn of the dial away . the body of this camera is built like a tank . metal and high quality plastics abound . the buttons provide good feedback and the switches feel solid and durable . it is a beautiful piece of precision engineering	1
just wanted to note that my delicious bars arrived melted as noted by another reviewer . i ended up placing in the fridge , and then taking out before eating . turns out , i did n't find them that great directly from the fridge . also , they just did n't taste as fresh as the ones i buy individually from wal-mart . i could n't tell if that was because they had melted , or just were n't as fresh to start with	3
i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly . i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each . what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes . it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature . the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze . when working with paper , this was not always an easy task to take on . several weeks ago , i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007. the improvements are rather subtle , but powerful . it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features . after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun . here are some of the beneficial features : -like a paper notebook you have sections , but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like . -you can easily link pages to outlook . i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings . it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze . -also , it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish . you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails . well worth your time . -it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do . i love it for that use . there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well . if you use a tablet , this is a great feature . -as was with the earlier version , you can add voice content to your notes . that 's right , voice recorded messages can be added to your notes . too cool . before you buy , you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version . you 'll be able to assess for yourself . i think you 'll be pleased . i fond it to be one of the best products for ' electronic file keeping ' that i 've used . for the price , it 's not a bad deal .	5
pure junk . i 've tried this several times . it does n't repair scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk . the first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface . and the second trick is to try to get your money back . the method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers .	3
i am in my early 30 's and have been experiencing severe and embarassing break-outs along my jaw line , chin and cheeks for the past couple of years . i have tried murad , proactiv , acnefree and many other systems without success . a month ago i picked up the neutrogena system when i saw it on sale . within five days days my skin started to clear . now , i have a completely clear complexion and have not had a single break-out since starting the system . i have had no problems with drying and my skin is much softer than before . finally , a product that works and comes at a decent price !	3

1. you ca n't print on anything over 8.5x14 paper . useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale . 2. i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3.0 of broderbund 3d home architect . it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	5
be careful ordering this item - make sure it 's the right one for your camera . while it says it 's for the a95 , it isn't . while it does n't say in the header that it 's the la-dc52c , it is , and the a95 camera requires the la-dc52d . i had to return the wrong one and reorder the right one . i purchased the wrong one based on amazon 's direction when purchasing accessories and do n't want others to make the same mistake	1
i loved this book . the food was really good and fast ( which is good because i have a very packed schedule ) . also great if you 're on a budget . the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants . the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy ( i 'm from texas , i like spicy ) , to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it . i just modified the recipes and everything was fine	0
collateral damage is the great and partially real action film in which arnold schwarzenger plays a fireman hell bent on getting his hands on the terrorist who killed his wife and kid and many other citizens near a shopping mall . with the attacks on sept 11 , movies have tried to cash in but collateral damage is different . arnold even dedicated the movie to firefighters everywhere in an interview with byron allen . the movie is brilliant in showing what only what the motivation behind terrorist attacks , but the depiction of slow agencies like fbi to counter these terrorist attacks . basically , the fbi and cia tell gorden brewer ( arnold schwarzennger ) that they are working to bring down the terrorist who killed his family , when in fact they have no good leads on the suspect . rather , than sitting on his butt , and waiting for the fbi to do something , gordon takes the law into his own hands and seeks to get justice for his family by going into columbia and getting ' 'the wolf' ' ( cliff curtis ) as the terrorist is called . there is a great scene in which gordon goes crazy and literally beats the hell out of a cold-blooded radio news reporter who says that the victims are pure garbage by saying their ' 'collateral damage'' . the radio reporter explains the reasons behind terrorist attacks but shows no feeling for victims . i loved this scene , because this reporter clearly has no remorse for the dead . he probably has no family of his own , and does n't know the meaning of life , except to cover his own . now you might say to yourself what 's the difference between arnold 's character ( who is going for justice ) and the terrorist well here is the big difference from arnold himself : ' 'the difference between me and you is that i am only going to kill you'' . unbelievable action and twists at the end , that you 're literally be on the edge of youre seat , and just when you think the movie is over... . it 's not ! ! ! director andrew davis not only gives a fact type based movie based on columbia , but also a factual based type movie that deals with terrorism and the lessons that we must learn to see that things like this do n't happen again . in fact , most people will remember the horrible case of wall street reporter , daniel pearl , who was executed after the u.s. failed to meet the demands of the middle east terrorist holding . the u.s. should have gone after these terrorists like the way arnold does in this movie . but then the u.s. does not have a great track record when it comes to nailing terrorist even going back to the 1970 's the u.s. supported and backed up madmen like general pinochet in chile and dictator samoza in nicaragua . both of them killed hundreds of people with u.s. backing and funding . still though ' 'collateral damage' ' is a great action film that you must see .	2
this album was by far the bands most daring ablum . they went away from the classic inxs sound that made them superstars ( kick , x ) and instead updated their sound to fit the time . like a previous reviewer noted , this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the us , and unfortunately , caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part . its sad too , cuz there are many solid tracks , inlcuding heaven sent ( my favorite ) , not enough time , baby dont cry and beautiful girl . i have recently become a big fan of inxs and have purchased all of their albums . i like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums . i recommend " welcome " to any inxs fan and any other fan of great music	4
this completely lacks the charm and subtlety of the original . overblown , overproduced mackintosh garbage . if he could have found an excuse to land a helicopter on the stage , i 'm sure he would n't have hesitated . mr. banks has been turned into a one dimensional clown and his songs have all been changed for the worst . and the omission of " sister suffragettes " smacks of pc nonsense	4
the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life . i found myself saying " oh come on " to one plot point after another ( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities ) . the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving ( previous reviews in this thread provide details )	2

just look how many are for sale , thats got to be a clue on how horrible this film is . it has so much nudity and bad language it was disgusting . i fastforwarded about 70% of the movie ! and what got me was on the back it says " family-friendly " im still laughing about that ! what has this world come to ? i would never let my kids watch it let alone anyone ! even my husband was disgusted and wanted me to write this review so some poor person does n't buy or rent this movie . im embarassed that i rented it ! please turn away now	2

this is quite a sharp turn from francine 's previous album ( 40 on a fall day ) ... whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble 's work in poundcake , this time around it 's quieter , subtler , sweeter and sadder . make no mistake , this is a break-up album . even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold , lonely , hug-craving feeling only the best break-up albums can . the mood will draw you in and keep you listening , but after a few listens it 's the songs you 'll fall in love with . ahh , the songs . they 're densely packed with chord changes , odd but appealing lyrics , and unexpected instrumentation . they 're hooky without being obvious ( a francine specialty ) . this was my favourite album of 2003 , and i still listen to it pretty often these days . best tracks : this sunday 's revival , silver plated 606 , novelty , 13 years . best lyric : " read a year old mail / now you should 've told me / i 've been repeating myself / only far less convincingly	4

i have to tell you lionel hampton has yet to be matched in talent , and drive on the " phones . " funny story , it was tito puente the late and legendary " king of the mambo " was the one who showed lionel ( by carefull persuation ) the light of the " phones " and shuned him away from the piano . unfortunatly not much was known on this subject of the two meeting but i believe they meet in the service or right after tito was discharged for ww ii . i can tell you lionel , to me , is best know for his big version of " flying home " . a bigger , badder version of the small groups version he did with benny goodman , and teddy wilson . lionels closest match would have to be red narrvo form the 1930 's , but still mr. hampton ' s drive and moves on the stage has yet to be matched	4
great cd for young and old alike . the music puts a smile on your face each time you listen to it . i have it on in my car and it keeps me in a good mood at all times	4
less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition , this book more aptly excerpts the author 's personal conflicts with human relationships.....a one-on-one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges . the book is a good read for academic analysis , but not so fun for venturist philosophy	0
if you 're intimidated by tolstoy or dostoevsky 's long masterpieces , consider starting instead with turgenev 's " fathers and sons . " this book is of course a masterpiece of russian literature . it 's characters and themes are timeless and absolutely relatable to our modern culture . this is a story of family relationships , romance , and philosophy . highly recommended . p.s. when you 're done here , try " war and peace " or at least " crime and punishment .	0
i bought adobe elements 5.0 because i thought it had more features than microsoft digital image suite , and it probably does . getting the adobe software to work is the trick . i even bought two books to help me learn how to use adobe and i still ca n't get it to work right . i should have stuck with microsoft , it is much easier to use .	5

i was a private beta tester for the new os . i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it . if you depend on stability for your existing software , you are out of luck . the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible . many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista . you are better off upgrading to a mac . after all , microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers .	5
..and what 's the point ? all of these songs ( minus a few ) are on the anthology , along with countless others . the beastie boys did n't put this out , their record label did . it 's just way for corporate to make money . if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan , that is you 're interested in all the other music they made that was n't put on radio , then do n't buy this . if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song , then go ahead . the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits . to fully appreciate them , you have to listen to an album all the way through .	4

it just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become . nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance : ashlee simpson , lindsay lohan , and now paris hilton ? lmao ! no seriously though , i 'm still totally not sure how paris hilton became so famous . yes , i know she 's the hilton hotel heiress , but i 'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention . all she did was live off her family fortune , but now thanks to that fortune , she was able to get the right contacts , to make her own record label called " heiress records " which is a sub-label of warner bros . after a reality show series , modeling career , a sex tape , and a couple of roles in a few movies , what did she think to herself ? i think i want to be a singer now ? apparently . and thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about . " stars are blind " is her first single off her debut album " paris " and let me tell you it 's nothing new or original . the song has kind of a ska beat , which i really do n't think much of . her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon , and the lyrics are mediocre . sorry paris , but you failed miserably as a musician . leave this profession for the people that really have the talent	4
this case looks good and protects the camera adequately , but is too bulky . it has n't got a lot of room inside - i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery . the belt clip is difficult to use , and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time . there are better cases for this camera	1

i bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the smartmedia ( which only lasts for about a month ) . i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed , particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges . even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it 's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious , especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer . so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides . the right side was worse than the left making 1 / 8th of the entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one with a bad lens . in any case , no thanks , i 'll stick with my trusty old camera . i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month .	1
i was pretty excited to try an ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked the idea of being able to ' control ' the amount of ions coming out . my hair did seem a little shinier after using it ( the only reason i gave it two stars and not one ) but my hair felt a little drier . almost straw-ish...it never felt like that with my old drier . also the buttons really are hard to switch...all of them ! i read another review that said that and i thought well how bad can it be ? i dry my hair with a round brush in my right hand and the dryer in the left . i turn the dryer on and off during different times while i am doing my hair . with this dryer i could not turn the on / off switch with my left hand . i had to put down my brush and use both hands . i could not believe how hard it was to switch ! this was the main deciding factor in returning the dryer , it was so frustrating not to be able to switch it easily with a flick of your thumb . not to mention made me feel like a big wussy ! ! ! the speed setting only has two settings , low and high . the low setting was way too low and the high setting was way too high . a middle ground would have been nice . lastly , the dryer smelled a little weird . granted , i only had it two days before i returned it , so the smell might eventually disappear . but it was n't your normal ' new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it was almost a slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it for the vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . that seems to be working better . the low speed setting is perfect . the smell is normal ' new dryer ' smell so far . the buttons are easy to push ! ! ! ! the sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) is a little off , it takes a while to turn off . but all in all i like it . and it also does make my hair shiny and does not make it feel drier or like straw !	3
i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i was due to fly out to palm springs . i took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures . this may or may not be because i am a novice photographer . even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around with it , my night time pictures will improve , but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me . no regrets with this purchase though . also , buy a larger memory stick . the one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and i had to run out and buy another .	1
another hyprocritical nut . these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus , while cutting your throats , not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists . the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks , killing native americans , and showing their christian love for the jews - by exterminating them . hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia . this is what these whackos envision	0
i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring . it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters . he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for " the swede " , without letting us know who the swede really is . roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration . it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book . i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times	0

i specifically bought turbo tax premier because of stocks sales / purchases we made in 2006. the section on stock income was confusing and it took me several times to figure out what information turbo tax wanted where . when i thought i had it figured out and finished that section , i thought i would repeat it to make sure i did it right . to my surprise , the second time i entered the information i received a different total than the first time . so i did it a third time . the third time matched the second , so i figured it must be right . then when i got to the section for error checking , i was told i had errors in my stock sales . so i did it a forth time , which came out the same as the second and third time . this time it passed the error checking , but instead of showing that we had purchased the stocks , turbo tax showed we had " inherited " the stocks . i could not get turbo tax to change , so i printed out the form scratched out " inherited " and put in the date of purchase . i would rather do my taxes by hand than use turbo tax again	5

this edition of the color calibration hardware and software is very professional - a fact that is reflected in the price tag . however , the difference between the uncalibrated and calibrated states on a television is very noticeable . the kit includes the colorimeter ( color measurement device ) with a usb connection . the assumption here is that a laptop or nearby desktop is available to calibrate the televisions . the software makes calibration extremely easy . it allows the user to select which color and picture controls the tv allows them to use ( not all televisions present the same controls , and even then , they often have different names ) and modifies its process accordingly . calibration takes approximately 30-45 minutes , but the results are undeniably an improvement . the kit comes in a sturdy plastic case with foam cutouts for the hardware and software ( much like a stargate sg-1 case for an alien device : - ) ) . while expensive , the software and hardware can be used on nearly anything that displays a picture - tvs of any kind and computer monitors - without limit . the one caveat is that , for lcd and other tvs or monitors with " delicate " screens , the suction cup provided to stick the colorimeter to the device requires a good deal of force . in fact , the force required is more than i am comfortable with applying to any display i have , except crts . as such , calibration requires one to either hold the colorimeter to the tv for each measurement ( not really a problem ) , or buy the tripod for the device . this is the only downside . this device is definitely of professional quality and is a must for any home theater enthusiast or the perfectionist in your household . it might even be possible to recover the cost of the unit by becoming a calibration technician.. . : -	5
as i stated before , i have a fabulous thing called " digital cable " . one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on . i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off . sometimes that happens with " digital cable " , but it usually it will right itself in the end . as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore . i tried everything to fix it including switching channels , turning on and off the tv , and things of that nature . i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining , but even that was a wasted effort . i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs-width away from haymakering morris . well , even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far , when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance . i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this , because it might not be completely his fault . for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices , or it might be because it 's his first movie . who knows but howard 's mind was made up . " rumble in the bronx " was to be rented . from what i saw so far on " digital cable " , i possibly found a person i could call my mentor , when i enter the world of stuntmen . when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what ? the dvd was messed up as well , the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on " digital cable " . i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy , telling them this dvd was broken . i returned home again and tried to watch it . " what the heck ! ? " i yelled , " is the world against howard tuttleman ! ? " you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too . i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up . i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window ( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me ) . after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica , i was still determined to see this movie . i ran up to best buy in troy , and i found a copy . i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version , hoping that it was a new pressing . i was happy with his answer and purchased it . well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop . i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights . finally , tuttleman will have his moment . well to keep this clean and short , let me say that , that night ended with a baseball bat , three ( 3 ) stitches in my hand , a broken window , and a hefty grounding-sentence ( we are talking weeks here ) . in conclusion , some movies ca n't be good , no matter how cool the stuntman , this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot . later .	2
private eye philip marlowe is asked for help to get to mexico by terry lennox . marlowe likes lennox and agrees to help him , but later lennox commits suicide in the small mexican town of otatoclan . but why was lennox driven to such extremes ? later on , marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer roger wade on the staight-and-narrow . this is not really marlowe 's line of work , but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with lennox begin slowly to emerge . this is a longer , more ambitious novel by chandler albeit displaying the same cynical , tough edge as the other marlowe novels i 've read . the greater length allows chandler more space for character development and reflection . the danger of this is that the novel could have felt over-extended , but for me it didn't . the ending did not come as a total surprise , but as with every other chandler novel i 've read , enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing . g rodger	0
i never loved a man the way i love you , what more can you say about the greates soul album of all time . this album released all of the music in aretha that was screaming to be released . it displayed a very mature aretha with complex emotions , very everyday lyrics , ones that make you say , oh yeah girl , lol . but also a delivery that the average person could n't lay down and dream about pulling off . this is just testiment that , even at such a young age , she was the queen	4
be advised , this software is for a single user , only licensed for one computer . i bought this for home use after using ss% for 2 years and v-com said it would no longer be supported of 03 / 06. i installed it on 2 home computers , it worked fine for 4 weeks , then it popped up a box on my second computer that i couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer , i needed to buy additional license for each computer . when i tried to use it on my main computer , it popped up the same message . so now it will not work on either computer . i uninstalled it and sent it back . just because it 's cheap does not mean it 's any good	5
i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout . that said , my initial take is very positive . as a writer and lousy typist , i think it will increase my productivity expotentially . i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon	5
i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the " ancient " sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera 's highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer 's editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n't provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it 's because the camera is so small it 's hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic 's poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony 's digital 8. if you do n't have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i 'd recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n't be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i 'll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality	1

i was attracted to the cannon zr800 due to the very small size and very low cost . however , you get what you pay for , although you get much more in other brands for just a little increase in cost . i 've already returned my cannon zr800 and replaced it with the sony dcr-hc38. the smallest problem with the canon is the continued motor noise , which you should be aware of it if you have read any review for any of the zr800 predecessors . the problem is that the motor is very loud , and you will hear a very annoying whirr if you are indoors . this could be forgivable given the low cost , but the problem with the zoom noise is not . when you zoom in and out , a very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go of the zoom switch . it is a loud click and when you play back your video this click is amplified on your video . it is impossible to watch a video and not notice this click . it is annoying , unusual and a big flaw with these new zr cannon camcorders . i called technical support , the person took a zr800 and tried it out and then acknowledged that a problem does exist ( she seemed stunned that this noise was occuring ) . bottom line , this camcorder is absolutely unusable due to this clicking noise and would not be worth using even if it were free . do not but it . btw , i love the sony dch-hc38 which is a bit more expensive and , like the zr800 , just recently came onto the market .	1
my grandmother actually gave me a small sample of regenerist . i started to use it and fell in love with it . i have suffered with acne my entire life and i have found combining this along with my salicylic acid treatment my skin has improved drastically . i have since purchased a bottle of the regenerist serum that had a sample of regenerist night . these both seem to be making my skin clear up and be much smoother for applying cosmetics , which has been a problem due to my skin texture	3
i wanted to like this book.. . i enjoyed the first two in the series . but this one left me a bit dry.. . babylon rising : the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips . this continues the story of michael murphy , a college professor teaching biblical archaeology . he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of " the handwriting on the wall " from the days of daniel . he 's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area , and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life . talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him , and there are a few attempts on his life . mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic , as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon . murphy , for someone who 's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean , finds himself in the middle of all this.. . as i said , i really wanted to like this book . the murphy character is likeable , and i enjoyed the action . but the plotline was spotty and over the top . murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him ( highly unlikely ) . everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time ( over the top ) . the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel , and they did n't do either one especially well . murphy 's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the " she 's so beautiful " and " could she be interested in me " interludes . and finally , none of the plotlines wrapped up . you got to the end and thought " so ? " fine if you 're ready to read the next installment , but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one.. . part of me wants to be nice , give the book the benefit of the doubt , and rate it a " 3 " . but the authors are better than this , and i 've come to expect more from someone who 's been doing this for a long time.. . if you 're committed to the series , you 'll want / have / need to read it , but just do n't come in with your expectations very high. .	0
i bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option . it was not easy to use , as you have to put in your information unless you want to use kilograms , and you still have to enter your height in meters . all that aside , it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%. am i an athlete ? no . am i female ? yes . is 14% body fat possible ? ? ? well let 's just say it is highly unlikely . i ca n't comment on the water numbers it gives me because i do n't really have anything to go on there , but even at my fittest i was over 20% body fat , and that was a while ago. .	3
i heard the first beat lp ( & quot ; i just ca n't stop it&quot ; ) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band 's brand of ska / soul / rock . for some strange reason , i never bought & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; and never got familiar with it . i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away . of course , i did buy & quot ; special beat service&quot ; and found it to be par excellent . so i ordered & quot ; wha'ppen&quot ; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i 've been wearing it out . damn ! how did i miss this ? this is a great collection of snaky sweet , politically smart songs . & quot ; doors of your heart&quot ; ... i 've loved that song for years.. . and & quot ; too nice to talk to&quot ; has always been a favorite . but every other single song on this cd , including the bonus tracks , is outstanding . these songs are textural wonders . great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording . i regret not discovering it sooner , but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact . oh yeah.. . one more thing.. . i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he 's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him . if he comes to a venue near you , do n't miss the show . you 'll get your money 's worth and more . wear your dancin ' shoes . he is truly one of the great talents of the 80 's and continues to make significant music . he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades . buy this cd . you wo n't regret it . it sounds best in the early evening . i 'm the big oh and i gotta go	4
very convenient reading glasses . you could hang them on your neck when not using them , and not even notice they are there . they are very sturdy , and are flexible making them almost imposible to break . cons : both sets i purchased i notice them to be on the narrow side . they sometimes can feel too tight to the side of your face . the glasses are also not practicable to wear for a person with long hair , as the glasses would trap your hair against your face	3
this is not a fad diet . this is a simple , straighforward and helpful guide on how to eat . puhn 's style is friendly and upfront . i read this book over two years ago , and my eating habits will never be as random and damaging as they used to be , because the principles described are easy to implement . great book	0
this is very easy to use and quite convenient . i 'm not sure , however , how accurate this monitor is . it seems to record a higher reading than a manual one at times . the value of this home monitor is if the readings change dramatically . then it 's a warning to go to the doctor 's	3
i am very happy with it but it does n't live up to my expectations . i also have the reg . plus for xp and i really do n't think the extra money is worth it . if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc . if i did n't have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine	5
when i had seen this camera on net , i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small & handy.. . except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always , its a great camera.. . the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it.. .	1
this thing stinks ! so much digital noise its output is terrible . i do n't know how they can put this thing out and have it be so bad . do n't be fooled thinking wow 8 megs for a low price , i have a 5 meg sony that is many times better . all that noise blows the detail out . get it if you like lots of little green and red flecks in your pictures , other wise stay away	1
i deeply love the music of joni mitchell . it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you , to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it ( as i stupidly did ) . the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it ( a new mature joni ! a return to the roots ! a brilliant acoustic album ! and nonsense like these.. . ) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see ( well , hear ) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years ( except " dog eat dog " which is superb , but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it 's an ' 80s disaster ) . it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening . ok , some lyrics are quite good , but nothing compares to the joni of the ' 60s and ' 70s . so , i really do not get the point : it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say ( how painful it is to face reality ! ) , so , why should all of you praise her ? just because of what she did in the past ? ok , let us say that she was the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation ( according to me , much better than bob dylan ) and let us praise her forever because of that ; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does , even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art . i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album ( and anything else from 1982 up to now - except , as i said , " dog eat dog " ) . if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell , try anything you want from the 60s and 70s . really , anything . try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins . you have to be prepared , for it could be beautifully dangerous : once you know her , you will never let her go away from your soul	4

i caught some of this on pbs and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast reba mcentire as nellie . musicals are for people that can sing , not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch . i 'm a native of arkansas , by the way , and it hurts my ears to listen to reba 's voice . reba 's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	2
this dark tragi-comedy resonates with the dramatic potential of hamlet , but and edge particular to jacobean drama . a play which is still relevant today ( many students related it to & quot ; the godfather&quot ; ) , and brimming with cinematic violence , lust , deception , vengence , and , with all this , communicated through beautiful poetry	0

i received the tripod ahead of the expected schedule . i 've been looking at tripods in stores in and around the greater boston area . you ca n't get a better tripod for the money . in fact , you ca n't get anything " decent " for under $40-50 and even then i 'm not sure you will get something this good . i had it shipped to my job and a few guys in the office ( which i did n't know ) had purchased a tripod in the past and where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 for it . conclusion : is the tripod perfect , no . the head looks a little like plastic . but it has nice rubber feet and rubber grip in addition to everything listed on the website . this tripod is perfect for the beginner to enthusiast photographer .	1
forget the fact that despite the grumbling about today 's " music " too many people just swallow and digest the slop record companies throw at them , " hollaback girl " is the absolute dumbest " song " i 've ever had the displeasure to hear . there are two main parts to this travesty : 1. where she says " that 's my sh** " no less than a million times , and 2. she demonstrates that she 's hooked on phonics by being kind enough to spell bananas for the rest of us . if this is supposed to be rap , stefani failed miserably . if it 's supposed to be dance , again , she failed miserably . to be honest , i do n't know what the hell this is supposed to be because it sure is n't music . the fact that it was number one for so long proves that perhaps people do n't have any requirements for their ears . - donna di giacom	4
i admit , i have n't finished this book . a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia . i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards , interest in astrology and angels . granted , i am not a firm believer in just " the hard facts " but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	0

i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it and then it just stopped working , so i recharged the baterry , no luck still the camera would n't turn off or on . so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again . no it does n't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might have short circuited . but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i have n't let anyone else use it and it has n't been out of my sight , never been dropped , never in extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going to try to return it or exchange it . i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products . before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo	1
a musician 's story . all factual and carefully done , showing a gathering of cuban jazz greats after many years of not performing . good photography , interesting scenes and good music . they still play ! well done	2
i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd . i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records . i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers- -lyle lovett - " lungs " ( among others ) and steve earle - " tecumseh valley " . i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording . other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes ' records . i come from a different angle . as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise , i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings . i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive .	4
as a tape measure , it does what it says it does . you press a button and the tape tightens around your body part . you wo n't have to worry about , " did i hold the tape tigher last time ? " as the tension is always the same for consistent measurements every time . the tape starts measurement at 2 " since the tape casing holds the tape and that part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape is accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats a regular tape measure since at least the button ensures that each time the tape wraps around you at the same tension level	3
even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , and even though i had to return it because it was too small , and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer 's review , amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera . to add insult to injury , amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault . ( it took two emails to get the full refund , and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping - - aargh ! ) regarding the bag itself , construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories	1
the four seasons have always been one of my favorite groups . i think frankie valli has one of the best voices in the world and without the doubt the greatest falsetto in existence , and the rest of the group had harmonies that only the beach boys could match . nd for band that has had as any hits as them are destined to have a barrage of greatst hits collection . up until now , i always felt the best way to obtain all the four seasons ' best songs was by getting rhino 's single disc " the very best of the four seasons " . well , i was wrong . " in season : the frankie valli and the 4 seasons anthology " is the definitve four seasons collection . on these two discs , you find all the essential four seasons songs , including " sherry " , " big girls do n't cry " , " walk like a man " , " dawn ( go away ) " , " rag doll " , " let 's hang on ( to what we 've got ) " , " working my way back to you " , " opus 17 ( do n't you worry ' bout me ) " , " tell it to the rain " ( an often forgotten top 10 hit and my favorite four seasons song ever ) , " who loves you " and " december 1963 ( oh , what a night ) " . but the majority of the cd is a wealth of rarities , including many songs that were either album tracks , uncharted singles or frankie vali solo singles . plus , you get it for about $25.00 , which i consider fairly cheap for a cd with 51 songs . the 30+ page booklet is excellent , filled with track information ( chart positions , etc. ) , rare photos and an excellent essay written by pat sierchio . this is an absolute must have	4
i just received my brush ( es ) hair dryer yesterday 3 / 9 / 07 ... tried it out today - for 5 minutes ... i absolutely hate it . it 's the worst , by far , hair appliance i 've ever owned . i guess you get what you pay for ... but i 've owned revlon products in the past , and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money . i cannot return it , because the return cost would be too expensive , too much trouble , and i guess it will go in the dumpster . i hate it - do n't make the same mistake i made . one big problem is that the bristles are so lousy - not firm and does n't grip the hair . just take it from this written testimony - it 's a piece of junk	3
i was thrilled to find this set here on amazon , and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly . all of the dvd 's have some good interviews with the producers , designers , voice actors , and other people associated with the show . i do n't usually like watching interviews / things where people talk a lot , but i love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was . i totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different	2
thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget .	2
i appreciate bands like ima robot , film school and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into alternative music , or at least i appreciate film school for trying to merge the beauty of electronica with alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the new wave you loved in the 80's . the thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band . have you heard depeche mode 's albums with a wind of boards of canada ? call this the album that it would have made more sense for maximo park to create if you will but this album is america 's response to all other international bands showing us off hard . ( the band is from san francisco , i believe ) and their influence for this album is a mix of electronica and 80 's music ( my bloody valentine . new order ? depeche mode ? ) all leading them to create an album that does n't quite call the band in question an american radiohead per se , but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars , accompanying keyboards , and a leaders effort to push the band forward , a band that is trying to reach heights of originality . film school 's debut ( if you are n't counting their imported ep ) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating " on and on " that may force your urge to name this band after interpol and elefant and a little bit of the bravery in there , too , but will not let you throughout this entire album . their current single " pitfalls " may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back new wave these days , but worse can happen for a band like this . the backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference . the second actual interlude " garrison " is where boards of canada 's wind starts blowing through the cd , before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of " cool " . if there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of new wave and the health of alternative , i do n't see a better candidate for leg-ups than film school 's latest . rating : 7.5 / 1	4
i 've owned this camera a little over a year . it was my 2nd digital camera . it always had focus issues in low-light . i thought it was me , but after working extensively with the manual , after i finally had some time , i discovered that it was the camera . you really need a tripod for those low-light shots . i was n't able to return it , so i 've taken hundreds of pictures with it . it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen . however , the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least $170. i 'm just going to get a better quality camera . i will not buy sony again	1
i agree with the two previous reviewers . there needs to be a user manual and there is n't one . the fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . this is n't very helpful for star gazing . the maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . this is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together	1
the sub-title of this book is very misleading . it does not contain " an action-oriented approach " to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action . the book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page ( " one of the things i dislike about myself is.. . " , " one of my emotions i have trouble accepting is.. . " ) and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind . for some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper ; and there are a lot of them , so be prepared to go through a lot of paper . sure , completing sentences technically counts as an " action " . but if you 're like me , " action-oriented " implies some sort of cognitive-behavioral therapy that gives you exercises to go out and do in the world , not sitting alone and writing out your thoughts . for someone with social anxiety the last thing i needed was more solitary introspection . branden gives examples of breakthroughs that his patients had doing sentence completion with him in therapy ; but alas , the practice helped me in no way . your mileage may vary , but i would n't recommend this book to anyone	0

it 's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting . written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added . would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout . truly basic and nothing new here - spend your money elsewhere	0

version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users ' favorite features , like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become . more than anything , version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely , providing complete control over your document , who can open , print , or even comment on it . but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade , as it cures many of the ills of the previous version . best of all , adobe has kept the price the same . very nice	5
i 'm in awe about what this program can do , but i 've yet to be able to use it to its fullest . it 's not user friendly and i 've been designing photo brochures , and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software . the corel_tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects . it takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program . and if you do n't use it daily , it 's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons . i was hoping the " student & teacher " edition would be more instructive , but it 's not . i 'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach	5

i assumed , incorrectly , that adobe 's customer service would be professional and quick . i have called three times in the past two weeks and have had to wait , at a minimum , 23 minutes just to speak to someone . when i finally got my product , they sent the mac verion rather than the pc version i purchased . i called again and waited approximately 30 minutes to get customer help . i had originally ordered the pc standard version and asked to upgrade ( and pay difference ) for the professional version - - since i still had n't received the pc version . customer service stated that they would only ship me the standard version to replace the incorrectly shipped mac version and then i would have to wait for the standard verison to arrive at which point i could call again , and ask to exchange for the professional verion - insane ! ! ! adobe 's call center is easily the worst customer service i have dealt with - - and i 've dealt with some bad customer service	5
i still have ther original blackmans shaver purchased in 1977 it still works ! this one works even better i have tried other remington shavers over the years the 850 9300 and the 9500 none of them worked as well as the first one untill now ! i found that by shaving in small circular motion as you move along your face you wo n't need williams lectric shave as i had with the other razors and it 's much easier to claen ! now if the just keep making replacement baldes i will be very happy for a long time	3

only knowing jack canfield from the very successful " chicken soup for the soul " mega series , i had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach . although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success , the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life . this lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit . lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions . a absolute must read book for understanding the real you	0
based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish , jason falkner and the beatles , i was expecting a lot better . instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to . is the guy talented musically ? yes . but his voice is mediocre and his songs really do n't do it for me . sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others wo n't be mislead by the breathless reviews here . i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre	4
now i know what you 're thinking , why are there two releases of " xx " ? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re-released the album " xx " but they also re-recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals ( big mistake ! ) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001. if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !	4
if you are looking for a " feel good " book about baby boomer retirement , this book may have some value for you . but if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to , this book is n't the answer . each segment-work , dreams , travel-is short and does n't address many relevant issues . for example , regarding the work chapter , the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap . well , that is speculative with globalism . those jobs may be outsourced . most are low paying . many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining . yes , there may be wal-mart jobs but is this your retirement dream ? the work chapter sounds a lot like most " do what you love " books . but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income . these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed . i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner	0
bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago ( three computers at home ) and worked ok - no viruses . then i did what i thought was a clean install of xp pro from xp home on one of the computers , and it carried over a lot of garbage from xp home i wanted to get rid of , but that 's another issue ( clean install ? }. after installing xp pro , i was warned i did n't have virus protection and so i tried installing my nav again . you would think at some point nav would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a windows upgrade , and that the nav was legitimate . nope - fatal error and computer lock-up , which i was able to survive . no contact opportunity at the symantec web site . i simply opted for microsoft 's recommended anti-virus software - computer associates . another twenty . then i had a heck of a time uninstalling nav , which would n't install and now would n't uninstall . what a waste of time and money . who creates these viruses ? we certainly know who benefits from them . there is really nothing you can do - they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout . this little note means diddily , but thanks to amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something .	5

i upgraded from the canon digital rebel ( grey body ) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level . one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation . i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my 7 year old son . we 're doing a research project on oceans , and while we have a few good resources , i felt this one , with its 3d imagery , would more likely capture and hold his attention . what i did n't realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine . for me , 3d had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches . though the book was described as stereoscopic , i did n't understand what that meant . stereography was something new for me , even if as a form of photography it is over 150 years old . this is not a matter of red and blue separations ; the 3d results from the human eye 's trick of blending 2 photos taken ( simultaneously ) an eye 's width apart . photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater 3d photography , and his work is beautifully displayed here . everyone i 've shown this book to has been fascinated by it , and i fully expect that when we 've finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home	0
i gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided . if you do have a frontpage server , and have it set " on " , it had some advantages over ftp . i bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures . i 've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years . i think a perl script using linux ' mogrify worked best . this works worst ! the free ones w / the digital cameras beat it . frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos - a next / previous button . you can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic / colage type thing . once you expand it , you must remember the shot you were on , back up , and then click on the next one ! unbelievable . i know what i need for handling photos efficiently . flicr has it - cross-tab indexing of the same photo . i think picassa is close and getting closer . this was n't worth the cost of picassa - free	5
i expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs , homework questions irrelevant to the material , insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are . this book really surprised me because it was n't " mathy " at all . it does n't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts , which means you only need common sense , not an intensive mathematical background to get everything . the examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts . each easily and naturally leads to the next . if there 's anything not thoroughly elaborated , they were sure to cover it in the homework questions , by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems . homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them , not just how to plug numbers into some formula . if anything , i 'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little . but then again , you could always just skip the easier parts	0
our book club read this book for our february 2006 selection . it was a really good book , we were all excited about discussing it . mr. johnson sent us discussion questions that really made us think . a few members felt that denmark never loved sierra but saw her more as property . the book definitely has some suprises that you do n't see coming . we really enjoyed the book . sistahs of ebony pages	0
i bought this video based on the reviews and was so disappointed that i never got past the first 20 minutes . i am not a prude , but to use the f word in every sentene as an adjective , verb and however else it may be used was a complete turnoff . i put the video in my recycle box . maybe it had some substance , but i could not get past the first 20 minute	2
my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing / smoothing products - - they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth . my hair is very fine , but also thick ( which is very annoying ) . this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down . it seems very expensive for such a small bottle , but a little goes a long way ( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished ) . definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all . the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming .	3
this scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy . here 's why : 1. the objective is too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe . i suppose it is adequate for the moon , but that is it . the planets will appear as very small disks . one will be able to see saturn 's rings , but the image will be very small . forget it for deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc. 2. the mount is an altazimuth , which will not follow the celestial object in the sky . the earth is rotating , and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision . a better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects . 3. the 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope . the observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 4. the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to " shiver " , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do n't be enticed by this scope ; it has too many flaws . save your money for a larger scope with a better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	1

having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series , the following are my suggestions . 1. read all five books in order . the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context . think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal . dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable . getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a 3 , 500 page experience . 2. read the oxford university editions . there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events . when you read 3 , 500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight . the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter . 3. if you really like any one book in particular , go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection . i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir . the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable . along with sir walter scott , alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel . i have been reading these types of novels my entire life . beyond a doubt , alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre .	0
in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that 's the only measure by which you 're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it 's quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it 's not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it 's category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade 's worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon 's raw software and control software are n't included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ...and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages.. . ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc. ) with modes that you could customize	1
i got for christmas , it was easy to use but only lasted 1 day then the screen does not turn on , , , stay away from this one !	1
i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures . i did n't want to spend a lot of money , however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use . not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working . however , when it did work every single picture was blurry . there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing . i would n't recommend this product to anyone . it is being returned	1
special effects have come along way from 1974 when westworld first came out , but this little gem still hangs head and shoulders above most sci-fi entertainment . welcome to delos , vacation spot of the future , where you can have a once and a lifetime fantasy come true . you may choose westworld , romanworld , and meadevilworld ! you can , for $1000.00 a day ( 1974 prices ) you can live out your most secert fantisies.it 's all set up to please you and you ca n't get hurt . of course if that were true then we have no movie . soon after the latest batch of people get to the park , the robots begin to have breakdowns , like a virus ( i still remember the reviews calling the idea of computers getting viruses as " to far out there , no one will believe it " wonder if they still think so ) . james brolin and richard benjemin are two friends enjoying westworld when the whole park goes on the blink and the robots start to kill thr guest . the final chase ( with evil robot yul brynner , still dressed as chris from his stint in the maganfict seven cloths ) is very thrilling and the whole movie has the feel of a park ride gone bad . a very fun movie	2
i am really thinking of returning it to amazon . i think i will stick with good - 'ol ms word . you see i wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it . it 's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos ( about 12 ) . well , all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf . the size of the created .pdf was near 10mb ! ( similary done with ms word resulted in a 1.2mb finished .pdf ) . well , i ca n't be e-mailing 10mb files ! i also recieved the book for the 5.0 filler which says it can use dragon naturally speaking ( i use that ) . i 'll be darned if i can figure out where that tool is , " you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar . " and , if you use dragon naturally speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters , say and select does not work . ( i should note that dragon naturally speaking works flawlessly in ms word ! ) so , you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence . finally , as others have said , there is no faq and generally no troubleshooting help on the scansoft web site . this is very poor for a near $100 product . there would be no way that i would spend $700 on their premium edition .	5
i 've been a loyal norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age , but like several other reviewers , i 'm deeply disappointed that norton internet security 2007 is incompatible with zonealarm pro , sunbelt counterspy , and microsoft antispyware , and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out . once upon a time , norton was the epitome of well-designed , thoughtful , customer-centric software , but they 've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name . i 'll be returning symantec 's software if i can , and buying zonealarm 's a / v package instead	5
good camera for the $129 i paid . does everything pretty well , and your picture modes are pretty customizable . only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than i wish when the camera saves / loads pictures to the memory card . might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures- - but probably would n't be doing it with this type of camera anyways .	1
i 've been using this since the first beta release , and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles . the ribbon interface is more upfront with the commands most ofter used , and my old keystroke commands are still there as well . after changing my default save setting to 97-2003 i have run into no compatibility problems . as with most of the bad reviews on ms products , it seems people are quick to rush with a bad review when they are unable to find or do something as quickly as they have in the past . my advice is to spend ten minutes looking through all of the menus.. . they make sense , and once you get used to it , you 'll never want to go back to the old way again . everything is cleaner , smoother , faster , and easier to use than ever before , and i have been using office for longer than i care to admit . let go of the past people ! this is the future of business productivity	5
i gave this to a bearded man for christmas . to my knowledge , he has used it only once , with no complaints . was nice for the main reason , he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one . this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it . purchasing was a breeze . thank yo	3
this is an awesome movie ! i think its better than anchors aweigh . gene kelly and frank sinatra are two baseball players named eddie o'brien and dennis ryan who play for the wolves . during the off-season eddie and dennis are vaudeville stars . when they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner k.c. higgins wants to take an active part in coaching . as it turns out the k in k.c. higgins happens to stand for katherine ( esther williams ) so the new owner is a woman . katherine dos n't fall for womanizer eddie so the two do n't get along at all ! ! dennis does fall for her though , but katherine is n't in love with him . shirley delwyn ( betty garrett ) has her eyes on dennis and she wo n't give up on him ! also in the cast is jules munshin who plays nat goldberg , dennis and eddie 's baseball pal . this movie has a lot of great music . the songs include " take me out to the ball game " frank and gene sing this song as their vaudeville act . also williams sings this while swimming in the pool . " yes , indeedy " the boys sing this song to the baseball team when they return from their vaudeville act . its about their love life . " o'brien to ryan to goldberg " kelly , sinatra , and munshin sing this song ! one of the best numbers ! " the right girl for me " sinatra sings this song to williams . " it 's fate , baby " garrett sings this to sinatra to prove that they were meant for each other . " strictly usa " probabley the best number everyone sings this at a party . " upon st. patrick 's day " kelly dances and sings to this great song . he sorta does this irish gig . kelly is truly the best dancer there ever was ! this is one of the best numbers up there w / strictly usa . at the end kelly , sinatra , williams , garrett sing to strictly usa as the finale . it really great ! the dvd has the following special features which are 2 deleted numbers called " baby face " and " boys and girls like you and me " . it also contains the trailers of anchors aweigh , on the town , and the trailer for this movie . also includes notes on frank sinatra and gene kelly . for some odd reason i love this movie ! this is a must see if you are a kelly fan	2
hard to believe it took me until now ( february 2007 ) to finally see this excellent movie and witness the brutal language and the violent gun shootings that made scarface so popular and award-deserving back in the early 80's . i loved this movie . it really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting , especially tony montana . a movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is ( over 2 hours ) . everyone must see scarface at least once in their lifetime . it wo n't disappoint . the ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense . watch it now	2
deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term , without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him ; making matters worse was the fact that bush did n't even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say " good bye . " colin powell came from jamaican parents ( often called " jewmaicans " by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education ) , and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little , if any , racial prejudice . later on , unfortunately , the insults were quite aggravating , but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance . powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny ( majored in geology ) ; however , rotc piqued his sophomore-year interest and he soon became a standout . powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet , and top graduate ( or very close ) in every military training setting he undertook , as well as a top mba student at george washington university . he also was top-ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment , leading to his being offered a white house fellowship , which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs , national security advisor , and secretary of state . one of powell 's " secrets of success " was to enthusiastically implement all orders , even those he considered silly - powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others . unfortunately , powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney ( a bit of a problem during gulf war i ; a serious problem when cheney became v.p. ) . between cheney 's far-right bias ( " out on the looney fringe " - per powell ) and bush ii 's " disturbingly disjointed " decision-making - per treasury secretary o'neill ) , powell 's contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with don rumsfeld 's help . in addition , he was often left out of important decisions , especially when out of the country . ultimately , powell 's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u.n. speech attesting to saddam 's wmd . the big question , still debated , is " why did n't he resign ? " his supporters believe the reason is that powell 's nature simply did n't allow anything less than 100% support . bottom line : if cheney had not been such an ideologue ( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v.p. - ignoring powell , and then sliding into the position himself ) , powell would be v.p. today , possibly president in 2008. similarly , if bush #41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in ' 92 , powell might well have become first v.p. , and then president	0
the scale is everything the manufacturer claims . however , with minimal use by one average sized adult , our scale lasted only about nine months . the balance part of the scale is very sound , but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components . i suspect that poor q&a will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere . today , my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand ( not too practical when someone is standing on it.. . ) . conclusions : * scale design is nice- -looks good . * construction of balance components is solid , glass is very strong . design and construction of the power unit ( battery ) is rather poor . * scale functions as advertised for a normal sized ( 80kg / 175lb ) adult ... until the battery power clip dies . * buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections . hope this helps !	3
well its definetly improved version since the last one , but they still have a lot of things to do . the biggest problem is pages . if text has specific symbols , like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc , forget it . u 'll have the same problem as 10 yrs ago , either funky symbols or underline dashes . keynote is much better . but if u r a scientist and not a sales man , both packages still have a lot of room for improvement . however , i 'm still happy with this purchase , because it 's apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future	5

i have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of nikon 's i use for wildlife spotting . i have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do . i am a serious nature and wildlife photographer that has used high end canon photography equipment for years . when i saw a image stabilized binocular was available with " l " glass , ( this is the symbol that canon uses to identify their finest optics in camera lenses ) , i bought them immediately . these binoculars are a little bit heavier than a non stabilized pair , but the weight is easily compensated by the stabilizer . once you press the stabilizer button , the scene will lock , and the effect is amazing . i tested them by looking at a sign about 100 yards away . with my normal hand shake i could not read the sign at that distance . as soon i engaged the stabilizer , the image locked into place and never once moved . it performs as well as my camera lenses . as far as the optics , they are , in my opinion second to none in the world . the image is significantly brighter than any other set i have , and the calrity and sharpness is incredible . the night viewing capabilities are incredible . finally , a huge plus is that these binoculars are completely fog and weather sealed . change amibient temps , use them in the rain , and the will not allow condensation to get into the unit . a wonderful feature for those of us that use our equipment in other than nice weather . things to be aware of include : these are relatively large , which suit a medium to large hand size . if you have very small hands , your may not like the feel of the unit in your hands . second , the lens caps do not perform well . they simple do not stay on the unit . although for me this is not a serious issue , it is the one area that canon could have done a much better job . you can get around this issue by attaching a good uv filter to the lenses . ( you should probably do this anyway to protect the glass ) finally , the strap the the carry case comes with is poor . it is too thin to be comfortably worn for extended use . i would recommend you find a really comfortable aftermarket camera strap to use with these . summary : outstanding performance and quality . a little larger fell in your hands than some people may like , but once you learn to use them , i do not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go ! i give the canon l binoculars a 5 star rating .	1

no longer intended to be a comprehensive reference , the guinness book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that are n't even actual records ( " most overrated celebrity " ) . if you 're going to do this , why not offer one edition that plays it by the book ? so dies a noble institution	0
i own the olympus fe-100 digital camera , and it came with unchargeable batteries ( oxyride ) . i switched to energizer batteries and bought an energizer 4-battery charger that can be had for less than the price of half a tank of gas . it 's not a quick charger like this one , but i say for less than half the investment , i 've got a charger that does the job . i would not spend this kind of money on a charger . so i say , if you 're part of the " gotta have it now " generation , you definitely pay for convenience . otherwise , charge your batteries more slowly ( 2-3 hours ) and save a lot of money	1
i am a big ambrosia fan and i love " biggest part of me " , " you 're the only woman " , " how much i feel " and the newer track " i just ca n't let go " . however , i wish this cd contained all of their billboard hot 100 hits . the cd is missing their cover of " magical mystery tour " ( #39 ) and " how can you love me " ( #86 ) . for the casual listener , this cd is perfect . for the chart hit completionists out there , it misses a couple songs . i bought this cd used for $1.99 , which was a huge bargain for the songs included . for that price , i can certainly try to download the missing tracks	4

a little outdated , quite a few beers here are n't made anymore . beer reviews are always personal opinion , and you 'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy does n't know what hes talking about . i 'd ignore what they say , everybody has their own preference . think about this before you buy this book : 1 ) why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers ? 2 ) its very out dated.. . 5 years is a long time	0

recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc , the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc , and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad . all this without any systematic mathematics . hurrah for the chinese . alas , like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor , all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared , somewhere either burnt , or submerged in tar . but speculation continues . meanwhile , spaghetti was invented there , without which no italy would have arisen . oh , and crackers , they invented crackers , and bed posts first	2
this book is for anyone who has ever questioned their faith , lost a loved one , or yearned to understand life just a bit more . sarah darer littman has captured justine silver , a confused jewish girl , within the pages of confessions of a closet catholic . justine is surrounded by her faith , but no one seems to celebrate it the same way . her parents have one idea , her grandparents another . and then there are all those other religions - - which way is the " right " way ? bewildered by this , justine seeks answers by deciding to adopt her best friend 's catholic beliefs . with the help of father ted ( a stuffed animal ) , a secretly purchased rosary , and a " stolen " cross necklace , jussy turns her closet into her own private " confessional " . what will happen when her family finds out ? littman humorously and compassionately shows the readers justine 's life as she struggles with her religious questions , her neat-nick mother , and , sadly , the death of her beloved grandmother . readers might not find out all the answers from justine , but they will definitely know they are not alone in the mysterious world of religion . reviewed by : sally kruger , aka " readingjunky	0
well , at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter . each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet . beware , the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while . the dvd has a different narrator than the original ( neal morrissey ) videos , but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s	2
i enjoyed the parts regarding the s.s. valiant , but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me . except for picard , who we of course know quite well from the series , the other characters were flat and uninteresting . we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week , boring . the whole & quot ; adversarial&quot ; situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong , and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard	0
i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1.4x . just keep in mind- -1.4x is only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but did n't increase the zoomage enough . i decided to go with a 2x ( that 's twice the zoomage ) teleconverter by kenko instead . i gave this one to my brother-in-law for christmas . you have to think about what you want- -i want to get in really close to the birds . i have a 70-300mm zoom lens and 1.4x takes it to 98-420mm . it is an improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close , this is n't going to do it for you . if you want to get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . as far as quality , the quality is definitely there . five stars for quality , 3 for insufficient zoomage	1
there is not much i can add to these reviews here . just like me , a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters . why would such an abomination happen ? suge knight is trying to milk the pac legacy until it is bone dry . well at least he has done something right if you ask me . it sucks that this is how we are forced to remember tupac shakur , over tracks chopped up into this . die hard pac fans wo n't even like this , if they have n't heard it already . i 'm so waiting for a remix album of " the chronic " and " doggystyle " . if suge knight was smart you would reissue tha dogg pound 's " dogg food " on dual disc , because that is the only reason why i do n't have that album yet .	4

i bought usher 's 8701 on tape long ago , and i remember liking it . then a couple of years ago , i bought it again on cd , listened to it , and wondered why i wasted my money . maybe it 's the fact that i 've grown , but this album sounds so un-soulful now . it is just lacking any spirit , sort of like an over-produced record : all studio magic , but no magic from the singer . even the songs that are supposed to sound heartfelt , don't . the album sounds dated , not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics . the songs are very forgettable , and i do n't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now . usher has yet to make a masterpiece . addendum : i was a little unfair in my rating . the album deserves 3 stars , not 2. unfortunately , i ca n't change it .	4

there is no other product which compares to the microsoft office suite . " microsoft office standard edition " is the place to get started . and it is the place you 'll probably stay . you do need word and excel , and occasionally , powerpoint . learn basic word processing and spreadsheet usage . shine in meetings with powerpoint . do you need to upgrade from xp ? not likely . there are no new features i found impressive after having the xp version for years . it lacks access , but most people do n't need the database strength of it , and will survive nicely with just excel . for e-mailing documents and files to coworkers , you can be confident they 'll easily open office files . there is a good chance they use it themselves . outlook is one of those highly underrated , but enormously useful applications to help you organize your contacts , schedule and tasks easily . you can use it as an e-mail reader as well , though that feature has been vulnerable to viruses . word is a huge program which can do far more than you 'll need , but it will allow you versatility and simplicity that wordperfect has yet to pull off . excel is a basic spreadsheet with incredible math functionality . i do n't need most of the math tools , other than minor budgets and such . i find it handy for tracking my poetry submissions ; i can see which magazine i sent which piece to when , and how and when they replied . powerpoint makes those cool slideshows with the text that can be animated on the screen . with the templates , you can look good without requiring a graphic design degree . i fully recommend " microsoft office standard edition . " it is the business and home office standard . you need it , it is easy to learn , and the price is right . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	5
i do n't know where this guy gets off saying that the drummer , jorge rossy , and the bassist , larry grenadier , & quot ; are competent but do nothing overtly interesting&quot ; . jorge incredible groove , use of space , and musicality is as good as one could ask for , and grenadier 's huge warm tone , amazing time , and great thematic development is unparalleled by other bassists of his generation	4

at last ! a full-length jimmy buffett concert on dvd ! it 's been a while coming but this is a beauty . there are so many highlights it 's hard to know where to start - perhaps the best place is the overall quality of the dvd . the sound is superb , the camera-work spot on and the real essence of a jimmy buffett concert is captured perfectly . the song mix is terrific - everything from buffett classics like volcano , to new classic like piece of work , to iconic covers like southern cross . seeing jimmy and the coral reefers perform in daylight and night-time is a nice touch and the crowd shots show why a buffett concert is such an all-encompassing experience ! for me , a favourite moment is the concert finale of steve goodman 's city of new orleans . steve now resides under home plate at wrigley and i 'm sure he was singing along as well . buffett fans and new parrotheads alike will find this dvd one to watch many times over	2
hello , ( i trully hope you do n't lose your money , because it trully hurts to buy something so expensive with high hopes ) . = ( trust me , this does n't work , i sadly bought both of them body bare and ladyfair . i spent over $300.00 including s / h and boy was i dissapointed . i would like to say , that if you would like to purchase a personal trimmer or private area shaver you should think about it , i would like to tell you so that no one else is fooled by the looks or sites . i also bought everything with it ! i got the entire combo and more . since i wanted to be completely shaven without having to go through brazilian waxing pain i researched for over 2 weeks ! ! ! ! 2 weeks ! none stop to make sure i bought the right product . body bare or ladyfair are the same . these trimmers do n't do anything , sadly a normal shaver is better than this . plus it leaves bumps and rashes ! ! ! !	3
this is my second favorite john woo movie with great touches of action and drama , when i first saw this film ( about 5 years ago ) i was n't used to seeing this much violence on screen ( and i thought lethal weapon was extremely violent at that time ) i was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped . this film is very violent but compared to other action films this is really tame nowadays . the minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots , some weird cuts and editing , the subs were terrible , as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad , but this is john woo 's first ( if you can count heroes shed no tears ) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse much worse . yun fat chow , ti lung and leslie chung have their good moments to bad moments , most of the good moments goes to chow and ti while leslie had only one or two moments . the plot is like this a cop must confront his criminal brother . that 's it . if your the typical hollywood action goer this is your perfect find . but as i said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films do n't make this your first one , i 'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on . but if your the hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on . this film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre . i really recommend this film to any action fan ! ! ! !	2
i did not think , that the women juliet lewis , plays in this movie was mentally retatrted , i think she just has a disablity.\ i hate that lable , if someone can walk and talk , and learn . i do n't think so .	2
hmm.. . ok , maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd , but i heard one of the songs on it , hashkiveynu , performed ( partially ) during an episode of the west wing , and it sounded amazing ( it was not the same cantor as on this cd ) . i am not jewish and not even very spiritual , but i wanted to have that song in my collection . i immediately searched the web for the info , got the name of the chant and found this cd . i almost purchased it without listening , when i found a different site , where they actually have rather long excerpts ( 2 min . ) of most tracks , so i listened to them . boy , was i relieved and disappointed at once ! relieved that i did n't buy the cd and disappointed that i could n't get the song i wanted ( i was willing to buy a whole cd for just 1 song , that 's how much it impressed me ) . the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing , although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show . and i 'm sorry to say it but the voice also does n't hold a candle to the one used on the show - way too " operatic " , as mentioned by many , and harsh and even unpleasant-sounding to me . it took all the charm and candor right out of the song ( in the show , they had a much more natural voice do the song ) . i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist . if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer ( if it can be the one from the west wing , i 'll be thrilled ) , please , let me know . in the meantime , i 'm passing on this cd. .	4
i spent a couple hours , trying to get transfer dv from my camcorder to my mac powerbook . after hours and hours i had to realize that the usb cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless . if you do n't own a sony vaio ( which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.link connection , which no other pc / mac has ) your getting frustrated pretty quick . i would have given the cable a 5 star rating , but the way i had to get the cable , by having to buy it seperately , is a big rip off . however i found the exact same cable in an apple store called " thin fire wire " . the exact same cable ( 1.8 meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact ) for only $29 and it works just fine . so check out an apple store near you and save some money . shame on you sony	1
nowadays , hollywood just would n't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism , unless it was an easy target that does n't spit back ( aka , america and it 's 1st amendment ) . this film harkens back to the day when people wished our country 's foreign policy was a bit more leathery . well...ya got it now ! at the very least , a film like this would piss off the surrender-monkeys in the jackass party , not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism , but for the villification and slaughter of stalinistic , castro-like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with . makes one wonder if the lefty glenn close now hates herself for acting in such a film . what would they say to a film like this ? unfortunately , there 's plenty of room for criticism in this movie , aside from the political implications therein . some ( arguably , if not all ) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey ( hence the 4 stars instead of the five ) . i think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything , it would have to be the 90 's style cgi , especially the plane crash . at best , one might go so far as to say it was " cute . " and what can a guy like me say to that ? even as i write this review , scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism , in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al qaida in iraq , al-zarqawi , caught himself a couple of 500 lb . bombs with the use of his house . for those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized ( not a far stretch from " fear-mongering , " right ? ) in the fight against terrorism , this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate america . what 's worse , they ca n't seem to ban a film exalting american nationalism such as " air force one " from those who wish to see it ( oh no ! ) . and just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about " the passion . " sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every american and not just the idealistic " intellectual " few , does n't it	2
i purchase two of the eva-dry edv-500 renewable dehumidifer and hang them inside the closet where i store my photo gears . although in california is not so humid but little moisture do add up . this dehumidifer is so easy to use - - unwrap it then hang it there . i check them once per several day . when the silica gel change from blue to pick , i just recharge it by plug it into the electric outlet overnight , then next morning , wow , a renewed dehumidifer is ready to use again . the changing of color is very obviously . i strongly recommend this item	3
when i bought this i had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster . it does n't cut it for a few reasons : 1. solution left a streaky , dull floor . mop & glo with water works much better . 2. bottle only lasted 3 times for a very small kitchen . 3. need to put batteries in the device ( something i did n't realize when i bought it ) . 4. not " cleaner than a mop . " if you have a heavy-traffic floor like i do , you 'd have to use about 3 clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around . a mop at least can be rinsed . 5. bottle is impossible to refill . i might have stuck with it if i could have replaced the solution with a water / mop & glo mix , but they have the bottle fixed so you can't . *sigh* i 'm actually considering spending the $$$ for a " scooba . " we have a roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream . if you want something fast , stick with " swiffer wet . " no batteries , no solution to refill	3

...i turned the movie off . was that supposed to be funny ? yes , some kids ' toy ( that happens to be a small motorized / electric model of a truck ) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village -i mean ; was this taken from the original stephen king-book then shame on you mr.king -that 's overdoing the terror already so overdone . not that the consept of " trucks " did n't appeal to me , but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so-called horrormaster so far -believe it or not	2
i have owned spysweeper for several years . i have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught . in many cases , a **portion** of the spyware was caught , spy sweeper did not remove the complete spywhere and i kept getting hits . tried out xoftspy software and it found and removed all of the spyware . even more , i get constant e-mails from webroot telling me that my " subscription needs to be renewed . " and that i must send in another $25 to renew . i got caught in their scam once until i started checking my subsciption date . they frequently send out banket e-mails telling people their subscriptions are up even though they may have as much as a year left . i have contacted them several times on this issue with no response or correction . i am only keeping this software installed because i paid out the bucks for it . i would not recommend it to others mainly because of the decptive business practices and the inability to perform as advertized . look elswhere	5
i am soooo glad that i checked this out of the library and did n't pay for this garbage . i really should of listened to the reviews on this book before i wasted a day reading it . actually , about half-way through i skimmed . the first couple chapters were n't bad , but the rest was just awful . gracie , her ex-husband , her friends...they are the most pathetic , shallow bunch of fakes i 've ever read about . what 's even worse is that 's the authors real life ( maybe not the divorce part , but the rest of it ) . in the end , all i have to say is do n't waste your time ! ! i should of listened to the others , but i did n't , and now i regret that i wasted so much time when i could of been reading something worth while .	0
i 've been looking at buying this collection for some time now and i finally broke down and bought it . very pleased with everything included . lots of stuff to use , and not just cheezy clip art - lots of boarders , symbols , brush strokes , etc. the bundle that i bought contained 1 wrong disc ( disc 3 was actually disc 30 ) - one phone call and a new one was sent to my house no questions asked .	5
with the new year just more than six hours away , i must tell you that no matter a full moon , half moon , quarter moon , or no moon at all , please avoid the flick " darkwolf " for many moons to come . what a joke . what a silly , stupid , insult to one 's intelligence . the script could have been written by my dog stan...and even then , i give him the benefit of the doubt to come up with something much more canine . let 's put it this way . have you ever seen a film that contained people that irritated you so much , you simply did n't give a ^ &^%* if they got blown away ? i was hoping the entire cast got mulched by mr. wolf less that 30 minutes into this loser . go " darkwolf " . take a few chucks out of this cast , its director , producer , writer and editors as quickly as possible...and do n't wait until the next full moon . " darkwolf " is an insult to motion pictures . more so , it is an insult to such credible werewolf classics as " the wolf man " , " wolfen " and " the howling " , not to mention the tongue-in-cheek horror classic " an american werewolf in london " . need i say more ? " darkwolf " has no bite . it 's claws and fangs have been chiselled to oblivion . the box claims this flick to be " half man . half wolf . pure evil . " in reality it is half / whole stupid . half / whole worthless . ...and...pure ^% &* ! get my drift ? at midnight...as we turn another page and the new year unfolds...i promise you you will enjoy reruns of every episode of " mary hartman , mary hartman " , much more than " darkwolf " . i 'm off to watch yet another new year 's flick before dawn . i need to make amends to lon chaney , jr. before midnight . bottom line , it was a film you did n't really care " where " the " wolf " came from , or where the werewolf was going . pitiful...embarrassing.. . " i 've seen the bad moon rising " but this one makes me wish it would set !	2
i ca n't , for the life of me , understand the appeal , or better , the necessity for the black crowes . to call all the riffs recycled is to give them credit for originality they do n't possess...there 's nothing here that has n't been done better , with more creativity and feeling , and of course , originality , by the stones , faces , et al...and it 's not a valid counter-argument that the stones stole from the great blues masters , because , of course , they did...but what they also did is add some value , something of their own , that was completely fresh...what these guys have done is the aural equivalent of sewing a new name tag on. .	4
do n't take my word for it that 's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on slashdot . be warned : adobe has not learned its lesson , and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6 , this latest release of acrobat continues adobe 's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment , again , as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done- -in fact , it 's now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version of acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues that these are conveniences , but they are entirely unnecessary ( for most of us " printing " to adobe pdf achieves the same result , is much more convenient , and a more natural model ) , and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface ( for those who do n't have the knowledge or patience to customize it ) or a carefully tuned one ( for those who do ) . unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior ( e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog ) , acrobat 's " option " for disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden in the setup process , is now almost completely absent . to disable the " convert to adobe pdf " button that mysteriously appears in the outlook mail editor , for example , one has to be sure to choose " this feature will not be available " from the " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting the button using outlook 's toolbar customization feature will not work : it comes right back when the editor is next opened . similar problems arise in word , excel , visio , project , and internet explorer . and there 's simply no way to get rid of the never-used " convert to adobe pdf " and " combine in acrobat.. . " entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files ( even if one installs none of the acrobat pdfmaker features ) . for the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that acrobat 7 does , there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web , but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7 : ( " adobe has really pushed the boat out with acrobat 7 and managed to screw word royally " ) . in short , acrobat will make a mess of your working environment , there 's no way to completely fix it , and even the partial fix is a pain ( and not well documented ) . ( this may seem a minor issue , but if every application followed adobe 's reckless example , our working environments would start to look like strip malls , crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it . one of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs ; no application should interfere with that . ) experienced acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for acrobat ( and most other adobe applications ) : it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version . in fact , on my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer to launch than the entire visual studio .net development environment , and longer than the boot sequence for windows xp ! there are other minor problems as well ( arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items , etc. ) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough . unless you really need the latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . and if the " improvements " in this release are any indication of where adobe plans to go with future releases , it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management . fortunately , there 's no reason at all to upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you can ( and should ) avoid this one ( at all costs )	5
i only glanced through this book , yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied . i can , however , write about one of the editors , mike shaw , who made no attempt whatsoever to ' find the evidence ' when assessing us as parents . he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london , england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an ' expert witness ' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act. we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were " at risk of neglect " . mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations . yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched . under cross examination , he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations . luckily for us , he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist . i do n't know about his co-editors , but if his work is anything to go by , the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced . here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court . judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously . evidence-gathering . " on 9.8.02 , i interviewed mr & mrs orman [2 hours] " on 21.8.02 , i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone [40 mins] , witnessed contact [1 hour] and spoke to the children without their parents [20 mins] [and] i interviewed the foster carer [2 hours]. observations . " mr & mrs orman were friendly and co-operative throughout.[...] mr orman showed insight [... but] was n't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children . the couple were very robust in refuting the [welfare's ] account , which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation . " contact took place in the park[...]the parents and children seemed happy to see each other ; they chatted in animated style . [...] i was n't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children 's presence " [interviewing the children] the children seemed attentive [...] but answered " do n't know " , fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions [...] erin related [a simpsons episode where] homer [...] had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside . i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman 's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed . [note . this is submitted in court as an evidence-based legal document ! ] conclusions & recommendations " [...] i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful . [...] " mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children . so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact . [...] i think there is some insecurity in the children 's attachment to their parents . [note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park.] " were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own , i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs . [...] asked whether he had any regrets , mr orman did n't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care . [...] erin [who was 8 at the time] needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper , and support and advise socially . i suspect mr orman would find this difficult . " my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness . [...] i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging [sic] children . " [...]the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed [sic] and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home . " [...] returning home is likely to further retard the children 's social and emotional development . [...] " these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse . [...] it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause . i also find very plausible ms [charlotte] curran 's suggestion ( ... [in] her [written] statement ) that mr orman dominates his wife . " the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me , but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible . [..] i believe the children need a long-term placement away from home with experienced foster carers . [...] contact should be gradually reduced . " mike shaw 's answers under cross-examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities , but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6-hour investigation . yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed , so that the children could lead a normal and happy life . he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70% of all children placed in long-term foster care end up as delinquents . our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt ; and the case was eventually closed . so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions	0
i was very disappointed that the version of & quot ; paper roses&quot ; included on this cd is an updated and new recorded version from 1990. it is not the original 1973 classic marie recorded when she was twelve.interestingly , this new version is produced by sonny james , the original producer of the original single , that also features many of the original studio musicians . so all is not lost . still , i prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this cd included an updated & quot ; paper roses . &quot	4
i have been a nin fan since pretty hate machine . i think trent reznor is a brilliant musician . all of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this ? i pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece . what a disappointment ! ! i still ca n't get over how terrible this album is ! the only song that is worth mentioning is " you know what you are . " that 's the trent i know ! i purposely skipped the tour just so i did n't have to hear the new stuff ! i hope this is n't it for him , but i will be cautious when the next album comes out	4
the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch , however , it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate . the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack . i had intended to use it as a cold mask only .	3
this is a cool game in a lot of ways . i was jazzed about it because of the era it represents . but the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting . the huge disapointment , however , is this : the online registration code is missing . utterly missing . and there is no resource available on the net to help . the u.s.a. help number is disconnected . you will not be able to play online . period . the developer 's forums are full of posts about this problem . no resolution... . beware . demand more of the makers of the products you purchase . this is extremely bad	5
so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont.then after a week it just stops working.dont get it , theres no flash whatsoeve	1
i have to get on the bandwagon here . this is a superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also have the tz1 , which showed promise , but has limitations . in my review of the tz1 , i noted it had lots of " noise " and pictures should n't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . the tz3 fixes and improves almost everything about the tz1 and adds some new , very useful features . the noise has been drastically reduced , the lens is better , the sensor is bigger , and the processor is not only faster , but produces better pictures . the tz3 adds a very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - the number of buttons is the same - which gives immediate access to five or so " most used " settings without having to go into the menues - of which there are several . the tz3 keeps the mega optical image stabilization and adds intelligent iso , increases the sensitivity without adding noise , ( i have not tried the 3200 setting yet . ) , increases the size of the viewing screen , etc. , etc. the tz3 is a " well-rounded , " and very capable camera . there is simply no comparison between the tz1 and the tz3 as far as the quality of the pictures . the tz3 wins hands down . in my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - a couple of which i own - rather handily . of course , the big selling point for the tz3 is still the 10x lens - now with wide angle capability - on a pocket-sized point and shoot camera . this lens is sharp , and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results . while there are no manual controls , per se , the camera seems to do very well without them . pictures are sharp , exposures seem nicely done ( have n't tried it at night yet , but low light forrest shots were excellent ) , colors were accurate , appropriately saturated , and vivid ( ok . i like the vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc. there are a variety of af settings , settable focal points , and focus modes . there is also exposure compensation , and exposure bracketing available - and they work well ! the live histogram is a welcome bonus . the tz3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode - again with excellent , sharp results . the tz3 is very well speced out . one nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the tz1. it was really not to inconvenient , but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake . the tz3 lens includes an built in lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , and have owned about that many others , i am most impressed with this one - for combined convenience and results . it is a quantum step forward . i also have a couple of quite nice , and fairly complete dslr kits . they are wonderful , and in a class by themselves , but when i want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10x , wide angle lens , or a back up for the dslrs , the tz3 is now my camera of choice .	1
300 plus minutes of recording time ( without lcd ) . i still got several hours with the lcd , backlight on . for when you are out all day , this is a good long lasting battery . on the hdr-fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting . that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me . i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height , though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time	1
having just paid [...] for this product , i expected the word processing component to have at least the basics . wrong . to me , the ability to easily format a business or legal document with " page x of y " at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental . well , works 8.5- --unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs- --does not provide that choice . without this basic a " feature " , you might as well simply use wordpad . i cannot comment on other abilities this program has or does n't have , or , on the spreadsheet or database modules , because i simply do n't want to spend any more time on this . recommendation : go to openoffice.org and get open office for free	5
i bought this camera just before a trip to ca and then a cruise ! it is very easy to operate ( even for a techno-retard like me ) and the pictures turned out great ! i have started to use the filming feature recently as my video recorder is with my son @ college and i want to film my daughter 's drill team performances ! i really like the fact that it does n't turn on while in my purse ! ! ! my old camera did that a couple of times , and i ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one ? ( lol ) all in all , a great buy ! 8 months later and the lcd display is gone ! literally , gone ! do n't know what happened - took pictures / movies of daughter 's drill team performance , and when i got it out again to take pictures before sadie hawkins , it would still take pictures ( i just downloaded them ) but since the display looks like " a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side " i do n't know what i 'm taking a picture of ! need to replace soon ! i 'm ( now ) bummed	1
i read other review , and decided to give it a try . as soon as i recieve it in the mail , and opened the box , i realized this was a mistake . cheap quality binocular with " high power " being a selling point . it came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place ! it is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation . you will be constantly ajdusting the focus . your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors are all cheap crap , and annoying to have it all on~ ! i am taking this back , and buying made in japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay for~ ! ! ! ! !	1
i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work . this is terrible , terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product .	1
i worked with the author in the narcotics section of the chicago police department . please do not let the author 's perception of the truth sway your opinion about the chicago police department and the men and women who serve proudly . the author claims that the narcotics section and its policies were a leading contributor to his decline . i think not . he thrived on these practices and used them to his advantage . all we saw was a selfish and immature young man who thought of himself first . if the author thinks that only the commander of the narcotics section was disgusted with his drug usage and failing his urinalysis , he is dead wrong . we all were . if you read this book , please do not indict all of us because of one person 's jaded stories .	0
i like using a tripod with my long zoom lens , and this device has really added to my hobby . the remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard . i personally do n't like cables , i do n't like dealing with them . this is just right for my purposes . the remote is also better for taking pics of people . it is much better than a timer in my opinion since i can move people in and out easier and more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using a timer .	1
this is one of my all-time favorite vampire movies . the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat , and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice 's interview with the vampire . the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through , and the cinematography is lush and sensual , evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads...even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire , and her famous line " i want some more " has been rendered immortal in movie history . the chemistry between lestat [cruise] & louis [pitt] is believable and in fact , they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie . all in all , a cinematic treat	2
this is a fantastic product . it has endless applications . i absolutly love it	5
this book is one of the best on understanding dogs and also for training them . our daughter dr. shannon dominguez dch who is head of the maui animal therapy program - - - highly recommends this book . [...] she has trained therapy dogs in a short time using these methods . we have adopted two little terriers from shelter and they are respondeing beautifully to the day by day suggestions on how to train young as well as old dogs and we would say these methods would work on children : - ) as well ! !	0
i am pleased with the purchase . very good value . picture quality is good and it is easy to operate . only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic . however , it looks good . this is my second purchase of this product : one for myself and one as a gift	1
this is an imaginative take on the jack and the beanstalk story . while it was apparently made for kids , the story maintains enough complexity to keep adults interested ( i 'm 19 ) . plus as a female , i appreciate the fact that it 's one of the few stories where ( possible spoiler ) the damsel ( who 's in a different kind of distress than other fairy tale women ) rescues prince charming . well-acted , it features some great chemistry between sara and modine . but i still ca n't give it 5 stars . here 's why ( spoilers ahead ) : 1. i 'm no math person but why could n't the writers be consistent with when jack 's dad died ? one minute , they say he died 20 years ago but then they say he died when jack was 14. since jack is 37 , it shows that the writers ca n't do simple addition . could n't they just take two seconds to do the math ? 2. how the hell does siggy know about goose and harp ? i got the impression from wilhemina that jack 's dad did n't believe the story of the original jack . but apparently , jack 's dad told siggy not to tell him about the family 's dark secret until he was ready . i wish there was a more believable explanation for siggy knowing a lot more than he should . 3. if siggy is smart enough to know the all the robinson secrets , i think he should be able to catch on to the fact that jack is in love with ondine fairly quickly . i always wondered why he did n't try to kill ondine when he was so against jack having an heir . i understand that they had a time limit to the movie and maybe it would have been a bit scary for the little ones . do n't get me wrong , i do n't want ondine to die . i wanted nothing less than a happy ending for her and jack . but shooting her ( or at least threatening her ) would have been a great way to kick up the tension / suspense . 4. siggy 's accent and mannerisms were an attempt at comedy that completely fell flat . it was not funny and was a bit gratuitous . but if you 're a fan of romance , adventure , or just feel-good movies in general , those things should n't keep you from enjoying this film . do n't think too much about the plot holes - you 'll go insane if you do	2
if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1.6 factor . if you love the fish eye style and have that camera , you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip . i was disapointed with this lens for that reason . the sigma 8mm is great . a note to the reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones . this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy . it happens often enough with sigma gear . with this lens , its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want . bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out . decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy . i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge . sounds like you got a bad one	1
this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class ! it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read . this book is horribly written . the explanations are boring , drawn out , and unclear . the early chapters draaaag on forever . the later chapters get a little better , but they state a lot of obvious or useless information . i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little .	0
...but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one , and alpha video , the distributors of this classic capra movie , made no attempt to clean it up . here we have an example of a key artwork about america 's psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the 1930s , crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves	2
might just be me- -but this is one of those cd 's that the song they play on the radio is the only decent one . maybe i 'm too old for the rest- -but wish i had kept the crystal so i could sell it on ebay	4
i 've been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that i get . i get a lot less irritation . i 've also used a similar product from lancome ( more expensive ) and actually prefer nivea better	3
i found the music rather annoying . it was not what i expected at all	4
this was a very informative read . i have gotten so many great ideas and will be using many of them in my own coastal garden . this is much more than a typical gardening how-to book . there is so much wisdom here and also some interesting facts . organic gardening is my first love and i was pleased to see ms. hadley insist on it in her own garden . a garden by the sea reads like a story as well as a great resource for gardening information . i agree with the other reviews here , it is like talking with a friend . this book has become a treasured addition to my library	0
i love death cab . i saw on degrassi , when an interviewer asks ashley and craig ( in the interview that they leeave spinner and marco out of ) they say that they are influenced by dcfc , i started watching degrassi when i heard kevin smith was on 3 episodes . get this dvd....it is sooooooo good , i want plans too. .	2
i read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class - - and then i read it again , and enjoyed it both times . de wall does protest too much - - he 's clearly answering his critics throughout - - but i found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing . more importantly , de wall 's arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive ( not that i needed much persuading ) , and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining . i 'm looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days	0
this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over-priced and disappointing cameras . i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003. from the start , the colors never looked right , especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones . i also bought the sb800s ( 3 of them ) , thinking the cls would be a great addition . but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments . the camera has a wonderful feel , viewfinder and reasonably good controls . but the results are disappointing . the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition ( canon ) offers . nikon finally realized this and on dec. 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price $1 , 200. it just so happened mine was in melville , n.y. , with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty . these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware , bad color , overexposure , blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value . i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers . indeed , forget nikon and go to canon	1
i got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it . i bought season two and was pretty dissappointed . the show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one . i loved the ideas for episodes , but did n't care much for how they played out . bill got soft . cuddles and dan got mean . buttons and rocko stayed about the same , but it was n't enough . great show , but stick with season one	2
i have always been a fan of movies that mix special effect animation with live action and the mask is no exception . i would also have to say that the mask is one of a kind in terms of unique films . there are many good things about this film aside from the well written script and good acting but i think the one thing that shines the most about the mask is the special effects and the humor that goes along with it . for those of you who do n't know , a big portion of the effects and humor from this movie stem from the old tex avery cartoons such as droopy the dog and the lone wolf who lusts after the nightclub dancer in a red dress ( this feature is shown in the bonus section of the dvd ) . these kind of cartoons were always my favorite growing up aside from looney tunes . getting back on the subject , what i also found thrilling about the mask is how well the dog milo was trained to perform certain task . if you have seen this movie , you know what i 'm talking about . the training of the dog is also shown in the bonus section of the dvd . the movie itself was a take-off of the comic series of the mask . though not quite as dark as the comics , the film itself managed to portray enough adult humor and semi-violence so that the mask would not be deemed as a children 's film hence the pg-13 rating . a big plus to the mask was how jim carrey portrayed the different character traits of stanley ipkis and stanley ipkis wearing the mask . another big plus about this movie is the main villain getting hold of the mask . and of course , who can dislike ben stein 's typical character of a monotone man with sarcastic remarks ? oh , and cameron diaz is an absolute babe in this movie as well . as for the dvd , this re-release is an improvement from the previous . you get 5.1 surround sound along with a crisp widescreen picture . the added bonus features are also great and should be viewed to appreciate what was put in to making this movie	2
what is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book - - which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel - - is not that fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24. nope , the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced " the great gatsby " a mere five years later . " this side of paradise " is a mess : it is as uneven , affected , feebly pretentious and relentlessly immature as its hero , the tiresomely self-conscious young minnesotan-gone-to-princeton amory blaine . ( one suspects , in fact , that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory 's diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book 's structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable , at least . ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book , in terms of sales , ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public 's recognition of something new and revealing in it . okay , amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc. ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably , one can accept , a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy 's readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war . welp , here it comes : " on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon , the ` petting party . ' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed . " to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is , of course , very small beer . what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now , in the best cases of the paradise narrative , as unalarming quaintness . while this is not exactly fitzgerald 's " fault " , so to speak , it is also true that the use of " shocking revelations " of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes . in any event , the price the reader pays here , in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory 's adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties , is very , very high for payoffs of such modest proportions . i mean , come on : " for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart . the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds , he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it . eleanor was , say , the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty , the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes . " yikes . i do n't care what new generation you 're talking about , can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like , even admire , here and there in paradise . fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( e.g. , " they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered . " " sometimes i wish i 'd been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy . " " it 's better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better . " ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator 's observations is , in its now-curious way , refreshingly , bracingly funny : " slowly and inevitably , yet with a sudden surge at the last , while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] , war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played . every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings . when amory went to washington the next weekend , he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks , he guessed , or russians . " nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there 's a war on , i always say . anyway , most of the novel consists of young amory 's elaborate ponderings - - romantic , philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable . i 've forgotten them already . at some level , in any case , fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was , of course , a not-very-disguised version of himself . for how else , if not as commendably self-deprecating irony , are we to take this observation ? " amory was in full stride , confident , nervous , and jubilant . scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do , so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him , and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours . " in the end , in any event , one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder . in paradise almost nothing works : form , content , narrative stance , dialogue , character development , pacing - - you name it , it 's a problem . yet in gatsby , five years later , everything works - - everything . if there is to be a great american novel , it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor . while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b , the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun . so while " this side of paradise " hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon , it surely deserves our respect , and indeed our gratitude , for what it led to .	0
this is a decent book on photographing artwork - - but not the the most comprehensive . the strengths of this book are that mr. saddington ( 1 ) discusses the use digital media , and ( 2 ) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout . the user-friendly aspect is the book 's strongest selling point , especially for artists who are new or novices at photography , or visually oriented ( i.e. , no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures ) . mr. saddington 's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure / photograph , and provides a concise explanation for these results , and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure / photograph . he also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing . the weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately , mr. saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... i base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called & quot ; photographing your artwork&quot ; by russell hart . if you buy mr. saddington 's book , i 'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of mr. hart 's book . the two books complement each other . where mr. saddington 's book lacks in details , mr. hart 's book fills in the information gaps . on the other hand , mr. hart 's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you 're a visually-oriented person , mr. saddington 's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process . again , mr. saddington 's book is decent , but it should be used as a supplemental reference , especially for the visually-oriented person	0
i really do n't want to be mean , but i find this album very shallow . classical indian music is a very complex , subtle and beautiful thing . comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience , but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy " world music " cliches . i do n't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting . and this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything , i have delved deep into the avante guard , minimalism , " new music " , eastern and western music theory , microtonal , etc. i would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing . however if your mainstay is jungle / drum&bass , then this would be a step up for you , so go for it , it is worth the pruchase in that case	4
for a basic money management software , this product met my expectations . no frills but very easy to use . convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction . i set my account up in 20 minutes . there is n't a manual but for the price and ease of use , i do n't need one	5
i am not a computer geek or techie at all , most software and hardware changes always make me hold my breath and cross my fingers . i recently purchased the kaspersky anti virus based on the review of it in consumers reports . it installed easily , updates automatically and frequently . very satisfied with it .	5
this product is a piece of garbage.when it works , it does what it is suppose to do . however , it worked for the first two weeks and then totally died on me.do not buy this product	3
installing the software was a piece of cake , using it is quite another matter . the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles , tweaks and options . first attempts ? the moon came out real nice , but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail . nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site . will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well ( oh - was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions - sorry celestron !	1
bought system mechanic 6 pro online , it repairs but reports problems but you cannot get information at all . none of the modules report what is being done . if you need assistance forget it , all you get from iolo is go see the faq 's , i do n't think humans work there just a computer that generates emails . stay away from this company ! !	5
first of all , ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do . ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina . tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like " all the others . " ike took advantage of her . tina her self said she cared very much for him . cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him . even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened . tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career , she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on . so she released her autobiography in 1986 , well after her come-back in 1984. while ike can try to deny it all he wants , the truth is he violently abused tina ! and considering the person ike turner is , i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back ! !	0
kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth . the dreaming was underrated when it was first released , but i think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time . this is a superb album , tracks like sat in your lap , suspended in gaffa , leave it open , night of the swallow , houdini , and get out of my house proving this point . there 's lots of anger on this album , as kate put it herself many years ago , and it is her " darkest " effort to date , but it 's pure brilliance ! buy it and be convinced.... .	4
the e550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed , you must have the camera 's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens . so this means if the subject is moving around a lot , such as my daughter playing soccer , you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you ca n't zoom out . as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful . i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off , etc. another negative is that the viewfinder does n't show the zoomed in image , you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot , which can be difficult in bright sunlight	1
this product is so good . i love it ! i can make my own mp3 's , make disk copies and archive data files . i 'm curious to see how dvd movies are made with this product . i 'm very happy with this item . the price is very pleasing as well .	5
maybe i 'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together , but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product . to accomplish the reports that i need , i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose . so , it gets the report done , just not as nicely as i had hoped . tracking work is made incredibly simple . rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	5
i love this seasion but the packaging could be better , i got cut with my copy of it	2
use less than 3 times , the touch screen does n't work.do n't know why~	1
the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it 's cheap . i used it on a 1 , 000 mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it . the navigation is poor . i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was " off route " so often due to the poor maps . the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n't provide a chime when it 's time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n't guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well . but the maps are poor , as is the verbal instruction - it sounds like a 1980 's computer generated voice . if you 're looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas - this is n't it . this is going back asap .	5
knuff respect to public enemy , they are one of the few groups in hip-hop history who 've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics . with that said , this single blows . it 's trash . the beats are trash , chuck d and flavor flav do n't rap , the dvd is just them hanging out in some clubs . it 's a shame , legends such as public enemy are far above this remedial single . if you want to hear their best worx , go and buy fear of a black planet , or it takes a nation of millions to hold us back . you wo n't be dissapointed. .	4
though being a nikonist for years and knowing the possibilities of that camera i could never imagine the results and performance of this item , easy to handle , incredible small for the capacity and giving the same options to get the same quality of pictures than the d80.i have both	1
i bought this camera because i 'm going to jamaica and i needed a camera , the video camera was a bonus . when i first tested it , it was during the night time , however in a well lit room , but i could n't see anything . i figured i could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day . when i stepped outside , which was very bright and sunny , all i could see on the screen was white . i tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen . the only time i actually saw anything on my screen was when i was inside during the day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i had bought it at wal-mart and they were happy to refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera . i would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option	1
once upon a time i was given a vanity-published book to review . it was an illogical mess , full of breathtaking non-sequiturs . while reading " iron john , " i could n't help thinking of it . the vanity book , however , was at least entertaining . john eldredge refers to " iron john " liberally in his book " wild at heart , " and because i considered that a ringing endorsement , i purchased a copy . i ca n't tell you what a chore it has been to finally finish reading it . the hardest part was not flinging it away in disgust about 17 times . it 's one thing to write a rambling tome full of obscure references ; it 's another to publish it . that people can slog through it and call it " profound " and " important " is baffling ; what 's even more mind-boggling is that people claim that this book " spoke " to them . i think it 's a case of " i 'd better say i understand it , or people will think i 'm not erudite . " well , let me be erudite about it : " iron john " is a big , steaming pile of new age crapola . do n't say i did n't warn you	0
i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved . we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it . therefore , my family bought me this sony for my b-day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned . if you have any movement ( such as action shots or small children ) the picture always comes out blurry . what a pain ! also , the picture quality is horrible . i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak	1
the main problem i have with this cd is that it seems poorly mixed . there is no sonic depth to it - all the sounds are flat and hard to distinguish from each other	4
my main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of echo park , a little area nestled next to downtown los angeles . i moved to echo park in late 2004. it 's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs , dropping-out , and domestic violence . and it 's all here , told through the eyes of latina teenagers . it was easy to see the woman 's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played . i did n't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven . i also found myself not caring about any of the characters . so-and-so gets shot , la la loo goes to jail . whatever ! as an aside , though , the evil neighborhood druglord was called ernesto . it turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called ernesto . luckily , it 's just a coincidence	2
i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back . however , immediately after opening the product , i tried to plug it in , as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged . unfortunately , this massager would plug in but did not start charging , and therefore , it could not be charged . i will be returning this item	3
first of all i 'm a die hard ufo fan , i own every ufo album not just the michael shenker cd's ...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1 ) do the band a disservice 2 ) are smokin crack , and 3 ) are very inept in your musical judgement . while i 'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god , and i hate to break the news to ya 's but for overall sound / effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song . that bein said making contact is one of the top five ufo albums made ! ! ! ! the top five ufo albums any fan should get are ( phenomenon , lights out , no place to run , making contact , and walk on water ) along with the two live cd 's bbc , and strangers in the night . misdemeaner has some cool 80 's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream ( and they deserve to be mainstream ) so who can blame them , and some of these songs are pretty cool...if , i might add if you have an open mind ( so that excludes most of you shenker diehards ) ...........	4

canon has three digital cameras for $2 , 500+. the 1ds mark ii , the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i 've shot most of my photographic life ) because of canon 's more impressive suite of lenses . here 's the decision process i went through . as with most products , it comes down to how you 'll use it . all of them have tradeoffs . 1. megapixels . more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged ( and cropped more tightly ) with less deterioration . the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp , the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp . if you 're a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense . if you 're a wedding photographer , the 5d is probably the sweet spot . in practice , however , the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people . at 8.2mp , you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels / inch without any enlargement beyond the camera 's native resolution . up to that size , you certainly wo n't see much difference in prints from the three cameras . that said , the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2. full frame . the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you 're accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera . the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor ( fovcf ) . for the 1d , it 's 1.3x . what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor do n't capture everying the lens is " seeing " - it crops the view in a little tighter . the result : your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer . a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on . because the camera is effectively " cropping " the edges of the image that the lens produces , it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get , and it does n't affect the pixel resolution of the image . my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you 're switching from film to digital , some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf . your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm . ) 3. durability . this was most important to me , though it may not be for someone who does n't shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years . both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200 , 000 cycles . the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100 , 000 , is not weather sealed and has more plastic components . 4. weight / size . what a solid , metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight . for those who prefer a camera with heft , these have it . for many people , this is a big drawback . the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz . , or almost three pounds for just the body , without the big battery . add the battery and you 're at 54 oz . the 5d is just 29 oz . and 31 oz . with battery . the 1ds and 1d , with built-in vertical grips , are also more than 2 inches taller . if you 're looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around , the 5d is it . 5. speed . there 's a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists , sports and many bird photographers . it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d . for most day-to-day uses , 3 fps is more than adequate . from using both , i 'd say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster , too . the 1d has 45 autofocus points , compared to nine for the 5d . 6. price . give or take a hundred here or there , the 1ds is about $7 , 200 ; the 1d about $3 , 900 ; and the 5d about $3 , 000. price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not . if you can afford it , go for it . otherwise , other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision . what did i decide ? first , i looked at how i 'd use the camera : photojournalism , travel and wildlife photography . the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed , so either the 1d or 1ds would do . in the end , i decided i 'd rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera . ( i bought the 300 f / 2.8 is for close to the difference in price . ) so , i went with the 1d mark iin . if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife did n't need a new car , i 'd probably have gone with the 1ds . i 'm very happing with the decision and the camera . for most people and most uses - general portrait , landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go . ( or perhaps the next greatest camera that canon will announce later this year .	1
i do n't like her routine in this dvd at all . i do n't like the strechie . it 's a completely waste and it wo n't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball . i solde the dvd the 2nd day i bought it . however , i do like her ' shrink your female fat zone , ' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body , lower body and abs	2

this camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a must . the price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores . so , i look at it as getting the case for free !	1
i bought this to protect my new dell axim , a replacement for my palm tungsten e ( and a step up ) . the axim is wireless enabled so i wanted to protect it . when i tried to install it , i ran into major issues . it automatically wanted to install to the palm ( seeing the palm desktop software ) . there was no way to override it or choose which device to which it should install . i contacted customer service ( an issue in itself ) via phone and email . emailed response told me to uninstall my palm software . how stupid ! i have no intention of uninstalling the palm just yet . meanwhile , trying to phone customer service was a joke . i tried a few times , once spending over 60 minutes on hold , another over 90 minutes , with no human contact . i have a business to run , not plenty of time to waste ! maybe it works great , but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out . amazon was terrific and let me return the product	5
in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book , hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century . the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details , witty asides , and ( especially ) luxuriously reproduced introductions . hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages ; he hopes to provide brief , non-intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science . there is astonishingly little text , and at times the pithiness , compactness , and occasional " cuteness " may work against readers ' understanding ; there 's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here . some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader . ( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time , event horizons , and brane world models . ) the text is aided greatly , however , by the beautifully rendered four-color illustrations . even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first , the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design 's artwork will attract , engage , and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation . overall , then , the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated . yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further . if you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here , i strongly recommend ( as does hawking ) alan guth 's " the inflationary universe " or brian greene 's " the elegant universe .	0

dave alvin 's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and / or who grew up in this land . the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises . it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state . dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said " infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels . " dave alvin says " we started with a list of 25 songs , from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between . i was even thinking of doing ' going back to cali ' as a blues thing . in the end , though , it was n't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting . " he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well . of them all , and i like each and every one , my two favorite interpretations are " here in california " and " surfer girl " " california bloodlines " is a sentimental rendition of john stewart 's fine work , which finds peace in knowing " there 's california bloodlines in my heart / there 's a california woman in my song ... and a california heartbeat in my soul . " " redneck friend " the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin 's style . " kern river " is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend , and it is a melancholy rendition . " blind love " from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style . " here in california " one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson . he felt this song needed a woman 's perspective . " i 'm bewildered " is an old richard berry , the great guitarist 's tune . backed up by the calvenes . " sonora 's death row " written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter 's tale . " down on the riverbed " is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin 's old blues style . " between the cracks " a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman , with a rollicking tune . this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd . " do n't look now " a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival . bluesy and fun to make it dave's . " tramps and hawkers " by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz , come dance with me , bk . lyrics are wonderful . " loser " by jerry garcia and robert hunter , is darker with more infused blues than garcia 's version . it could n't sound less like a deadhead song . dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound " surfer girl " brian wilson 's first song is done with doo-wops and again the calvanes did background . this is my favorite of dave alvin 's interpretations , and he sings this surfin'song with some tongue in cheek . dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd . voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the " brown earth of the state " to the frontier life and the lives won and lost . dave alvin had made his mark on this state , and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love . play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd . " california dreamin ' ? " highly recommended . prisrob 6-04-06	4
bought this to get short vid clips of my daughter to post on her page , so i didnt think i would need anything with uber high quality . but didnt realize just how poor the quality was on this one . in low light conditions it is horrendous even with the night shot on , and in good lighting it is barely adequate . wish i hadnt spent the money on this and memory card...should have put out the dough to get something a bit nicer . you get what you pay for	1
i am extremelly disappointed with roxio , the makers of cd creators ; especailly easy cd creator 5. i purchased easy cd creator 5 , sometime back from an affiliate of amazon.com . it was dispatched promptly and in very good condition . i installed it on my computer running windows 98. after some initial problmes it was running fine . a few days back i installed windows xp professional on my computer , and i got a message that the cd creator was not compatible with this version of windows . it hinted to contact roxio . i tried contact roxio with the help of the link , but found it impossible to send them my message . they have an automated " roxann " that is so difficult to understand . next they invite you to a " webticket " and you are supposed to mention your problem on it . but when you submit your query or complain , nothing happens . the site just stares at you dumbly ! ! there is no way to obtain roxio 's mailing address either . so now i am stuck with this " easy cd creator 5 " with no help from roxio ?	5

as a professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year . my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often , i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it . i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera . these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them . eventually , the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground . ( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! ) the cord is indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months	1

now , i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person - - in fact , probably more than the next person , since the average " next person " has n't ever read any . tales of derring-do , adventures to unexplored distant lands , lost civilizations , great artifacts , etc. - - that 's all good stuff . what 's not good is this book , which is tedious in the extreme . on the surface of it , haggard 's followup to his hugely successful ( and infinitely better ) " king solomon 's mines " has all the elements : a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers ( one of whom is descended from pharaohs ! ) , a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man , an expedition to africa , and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life . however , despite this promising laundry list , haggard 's execution leaves a great deal to be desired . a friend described it rather aptly as " a book with a lot of story , but not a lot of plot . " which is to say that in my edition , some 320 pages are filled without much happening . there is the initial mysterious set-up , the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations , the heroes ' conveyance to the " lost city " , and then.. . and then things kind of grind to a halt . lengthy descriptive details , lengthy internal ruminations , lengthy rambling speeches , lengthy everything - - but very little of consequence occurs until the very end , when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life . i suspect much of the problem stems from the book 's origin as a long-running serial in the gazette . as i understand it , serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment , and thus , it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible - - hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words . judicious editing could reduce the book to 1 / 3 of its size without any loss of note . of course , as another friend pointed out , it 's probably best to read the book is small chunks - - just as one would have done with installments . spreading out one 's reading of it over a period of time , he suggests , may serve to conceal the book 's rambling nature . in any event , there are some nice scenes here and there , such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches , but those are about all i 'm likely to recall from this book in a year . of course , as is noted in the introduction to my edition , haggard lifted the main elements of the plot , and even the the true name of " she-who-must-not-be-named " , from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer-lytton , so one ca n't even give him much credit for imagination . i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen : racism , anti-semeticism , misogyny , fear of miscegenation , etc. , but as entertainment for the modern reader , it falls woefully short of the mark .	0
while the story may be entertaining in its own right , and any chance to see donald o'conner dance is worth it , this can be a very disappointing film to porter buffs . the plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship . the story line is totally different and therefore some of porter 's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of sammy cahn and james van huesen which do not live up to porter 's quality . the best examples i can give is the fact that there is no evangelist so the title song " anything goes " turns into a second act number , sung by mitzi and chorus ( with horrific word changes ) and " blow gabriel blow " becomes a finale in the broadway show ( sung by the four main characters ) that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line . if you have n't seen it on stage it 's pleasant enough , but if you 're expecting the broadway show it 's a major disappointment	2
after leaving ( or being dismissed from ) pink floyd in 1968 due to his lsd use & erratic behaviour , singer / songwriter / guitarist syd barrett re-emerged in 1970 with his debut solo album , " the madcap laughs . " the album did not come easy , as syd never fully recovered from his drug use , and it clearly shows in his ragged performances on " madcap laughs . " producer malcolm jones did what he could with syd for about half of the album , before handing the production reigns over to barrett 's former floyd mates roger waters & david gilmour to finish the job . throughout the album , bum notes are played , beats are missed , and barrett sings off-key . and on the rocker songs , the session players ( from the group the soft machine ) sound like they are struggling to keep up with syd , who could hit a rough patch at any moment . for any other artist , this would all be nothing short of disastrous . and yet....in the case of syd barrett , any and all mistakes are immediately forgiven . why ? because barrett 's songs on " the madcap laughs " are all wonderfully written , and although syd 's voice and guitar-playing are obviously not in tip-top condition , you can plainly hear on this album that he 's trying . he 's really , really *trying* to do his best , and his efforts really do shine through . for every bum note there 's a passage that syd plays beautifully , for every missed beat there are many beats that are hit right on schedule , and for every note that syd sings off-key , there are many moments where his very distinctive , british voice is magical . and of course , there 's syd 's lyrics . you may not know what all of them actually *mean* , really , but to my ears , they 're still poetry . the rockers are still powerful ( " no good trying , " " no man 's land , " the rockabilly fun of " here i go , " and the classic " octopus " ) , and the softer numbers still have great beauty to them ( " terrapin , " the passionate " dark globe , " the effective " golden hair " - --based on a james joyce poem- --and " long gone " ) . even the more ragged numbers like " feel " and " if it 's in you , " somehow still hang together quite well ( amusingly , we even hear some brief banter from syd in the middle of " if it 's in you , " as his voice goes wildly off the map , he stops playing , prepares for another take , and finally gets through the song ) . when all is said and done , " the madcap laughs , " warts and all , is an excellent album . it is a flawed masterpiece , and it shows that syd barrett , even with his mind irreversibly fractured by this point , was still a genius musician .	4
if you decide to buy a current greeting card program , there are really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there are other programs available specifically for creating cards , but most of them are low quality and outdated , and are n't really worth considering . ( a competitive third product featuring american greetings designs is sadly now long outdated ; the designs in the american greetings program were of similar quality to those in the hallmark package ) . so how do these two products match up ? without a question , if you are looking for quality " canned " cards , the hallmark program wins . the hallmark designs are professional , and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store . in contrast , the designs in art explosion are adequate but surely not up to the quality of a store-bought card . the hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store ( although you are stuck with the choices pre-programmed into the software unless you want much frustration ) . the art explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations . art explosion beats the hallmark program in editing options ( more extensive ) , and in the amount of additional art ( clipart , etc. ) included with the package . if you do not plan to use the " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but the average user will likely appreciate the professional , high quality cards in the hallmark package . personally , i consider the choice of the hallmark package over art explosion a no brainer . a note on versions : the publisher comes out with a new version of the hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc. ) and the same is true for art explosion greeting card factory . having used many of these versions , i find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year . disappointingly , the stock cards in the hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years , and the same is true for art explosion .	5
i bought this based on reviews of " bass queen in the mix . " to me it sounds like the west coast edition of northern exposure without the 4 / 4 house beat . in other words , its very electronic sounding , almost completely non-vocal and not very funky at all . i listened to " eargasm " by plump dj 's and icey 's " funky breaks " after this and it 's definitely missing variety , skill in mixing and that " neck snapping " funky quality that make the plumps and icey so indispensible . not too bad but not that interesting either . i prefer her " mixtress " and still have not heard " bass queen.. . " btw , my speakers are flat down to below 30 hz and i did n't find the recording quality or the bass that impressive . listen to crystal method 's " phd " or " block rockin ' beats " by chemical brothers after this to see what i mean	4
hard , smart , creative funk can be a hard pursuit in life these days . even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us , finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch . thankfully , " secrets , " under the usually readily available columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $9.99. should this be a hard decision ? emphatically : no . although i can see where previous reviewers are coming from , trying to compare this outing to headhunters is truly unnecessary . with this ' 76 effort herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz , funk and disco but it all works . " doin it " is a super , super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the " man-child " sessions . and although " gentle thoughts " can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album . it 's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and , as always , herbie dancing on the keys . go get " secrets , " do n't think about it . it 'll always be an easy go-to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion	4
great camera . . . one of the few lower priced cams to keep the mic jack and the headphone jack , but beware . .. . this camera does not come with a lens cap , and no remote control . other sources state that this camera does not have a leica lens . this camera does not have a / v input . no flash , no hot accessory shoe ( though it has one which has no power ) . no widescreen lcd . it does record in widescreen but no image stabilization in widescreen .	1
i loved the camera , absolutely loved it . i was using it one night and it died . i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened . the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying . the second time i used it , i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger . i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures . as i was looking at the pictures , it just shut off . i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose . i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine .	1
quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for intuit products and services . in my opinion , it is fine to offer additional services to customers , but give the customer the opportunity to say " no thanks " and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software . forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea . advertising takes up space in the user interface and is a distraction that reduces productivity	5
i am not going to go over the contents of the book , or much about charles bukowski , because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work . i will just give you my impression of this collection of work . no collection can ever really be complete , there are always new things to add , new commentary , newly discovered works , transcripts of records and unpublished letters , but this book does an excellent job in its attempt . to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century , because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates . it is funny , sad , sadistic , cruel , scathing , enlightening and thought provoking . everything i like to read . this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers , trees and greek mythology . this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper . it is not perfect , and it is not trying to be . it does n't always work , but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski 's efforts . the guts to try . the attempts at honesty , clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything , and his cynicism of man . this book has one of the most moving , amazing , and insightful poems...or anything else...ever written . it is called the genius of the crowd . if you read that work of art and are not moved...nothing will . this collection is shocking in its beauty , and inspiring by its simplicity . enjoy	0

this is part 2 of a set titled say it right . the cd has a blue and white style vs. the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover . also in a slim-line jewel case with the title track , non-album track , but an added dance remix plus video . if you enjoyed the first 2-track cd then this is a must . dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production . say it right [radio edit] has the catchy dance beats , nice vocals , excellent drums , and chorus . the lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning . apparently , it 's about not giving a lover power to control , destroy , or make you loose sleep . the melody has great rhythm , chorus , dance styles , and energetic beats . " you do n't mean nothing at all to me " is repeated showing a strong message that life does n't end with someone who is n't right . what i wanted brings nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion . it 's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility . it 's about going for something you wanted but never got . the outcome does n't matter because the reality is you gave it your all . as she sings about her dream and what she wanted it 's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so . the melody is soothing , pleasant in sound , and refreshing for the soul . say it right [peter rauhofer remix part 1] is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet . the song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects , different introduction , pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs , up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers . straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes , swirls of sounds , and much club ambiance . it 's dreamy , fantasy filled , and definitely highly paced for the dance floor . if anything is certain it is this : the remix in this cd is much better than many of her past singles . there is true dj styles incorporation more instrumentations , effects , and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans . quite sticky , infectious , and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non-stop . club lovers do n't pass this out . nelly 's vocals are echoed often and electronic-a effects are vastly hard . say it right video [enhanced cd] is the video many have already seen as timbaland and nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced . this is an excellent video with much dance styles , highly energetic beats , and flairs for control and getting the message across . overall , from all of nelly 's singles i find this to be on the top of my favorite . the combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable . definitely buy this if you are a nelly fan , club hopper , or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion , different styles displayed , and the themes . it 's definitely a top sensation . before it sells out be sure to buy it . the part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you do n't want to listen to the remix . this is highly recommended for sure !	4
it took me all of 4 hours to read this book . it was insightful and entertaining . it was also sad . i cried so hard at the end of the book that i hiccuped for 3 hours . i work at a children 's home and have passed this book to several of my ' children ' who returned the book damp with tears and facing challenges with new resolve . i highly recommend this book to anyone who has to face any type of challenge , whether mental , physical , financial , whatever	2

i read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me , that 's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again . oh boy am i glad i bought it ! since last time i read it i have read many romance novels , many great one and many bad ones too . i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong . this book still made my heart race , made me smile at joe 's attempts to make ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them . joe 's character was just amazing , and most endearing was his insecurities.here was a navy seal , one of the toughest possible guys , and he was insecure about his upbringing and background . he felt veronica would be ashamed to be seen with a guy like him . he was sooooo sweet . he was so cocky , stobborn and arrogant but he was scared of rejection from veronica . just goes to show how a person 's outward appearence rarely show what is really inside them . i ca n't find any more book of this series , i am still searching for them . i know i have to read all of them .	0

the main character came across as gay to me too . this movie is in no way realistic . the other reviewer is right about everything . it 's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns , the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick . the & quot ; martial arts&quot ; in the movie are weak and sloppy , there 's no way that crap would actually work in real life . i do n't even know why i bothered to watch the whole thing , i guess i just found the stupidity amusing . the cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie , unfortunately that 's the only thing they put much effort into . i rented it from block buster too , they need to burn it . this movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something , like they had to make a movie to pass drama class	2

this is a straightforward description of reading and writing the arabic script . if you have no experience with arabic i think you would still need to locate a teacher or native speaker as some of the letters are very difficult to pronounce as native english speakers . however for the most part its easy to follow and would give you a great start , especially before you take an arabic course . if it came with a cassette with pronouciation i would have given it 5 stars	0
this was a wonderful game ! hours of good , solid game play . an interesting mystery and intriguing characters . a chance to interact with aquatic life . i learned how to work a gps and a ham radio . it was so much fun . the puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types . word puzzles , spatial puzzles , problem-solving ones . i can completely recommend this game	5
i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times . last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed . i have n't changed anything or done anything . i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera , but given the price i 'm pretty annoyed and amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
the boston based author , dennis lehane , wrote a great detective story with a social background so great , it is almost more important than the plot . " mystic river " differs from lehane 's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer . " mystic river " is set in the fictional boston suburb , called east buckingham ( the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester , charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester ) , home mostly to white working class , with plenty of crime . i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it , knowing the area.. . the first part , which is the base and explanation for later events , takes place in 1975 , when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car , and although he comes back after four days , his life as well as his friends ' is changed forever . the ways of the boys soon part , dave ( the boy taken by the men ) lives a quiet life , has a wife and a son , and likes his memories of being a football player in high school . jimmy , the " bad boy " , after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage , second wife and their two daughters . the third boy , college-educated sean , becomes a policeman . when jimmy 's beautiful daughter , katie , is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood , sean gets assigned to the case . there are many leads to different people.. . but the case is difficult . meanwhile , jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own . the plot is very good until the end , and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate . the characters are very real , especially jimmy and sean , who are central to the plot . their trauma after dave 's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways . they are complicated , multifaceted people , very well developed as literary characters . some side protagonists , depicting perhaps types rather than individuals ( bobby , roman , the savage brothers , sergeant whitey ) , are very good . i was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment , but also food for thought . the movie based on " mystic river " with sean penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time.. .	0
very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5 / 8 of the story . i add 1 / 8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism , but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate , but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run . there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained , but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade . these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton . repubs kept the song going without missing a beat . most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties . feel free to read to learn about terms , just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path	0
i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well , so i 'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months . as of now the battery will hold barely any charge , if at all . it 's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions	3
until sam raimi made spider-man , i think we all regarded tim burton 's batman as the best superhero movie ( even though i actually do n't consider batman to be a " superhero " because he has no superpowers ) . burton directed this movie , and did a great job - this movie looks like it takes place in the 1920s , except that society is a lot more technologically advanced than it really was back then . michael keaton is batman / bruce wayne . needless to say , batman is wayne 's alter ego . keaton is magnificent at playing the character 's alter ego . keaton also does a good job playing the character when he 's not in costume . keaton 's bruce wayne is n't as gloomy as christian bale 's was in batman begins , which is n't necessarily a bad thing . but i would say bruce wayne was a little too cheerful for my liking in the schumacher movies . but overall , bale 's bruce wayne is superior to keaton 's because bale has a much more developed character to play . however , keaton plays a better costumed batman than bale . the problem with this movie is that the joker ( jack nicholson ) steals the show - the whole movie revolves around him , so this is n't batman 's movie . this movie should have been called " the joker . " so if you ever wondered why nicholson got a higher billing than keaton , now you know . the thing is , the writers never bothered to give bruce wayne a personality , and they barely scratch the surface of the character 's background - we know practically nothing about wayne . you 'd think the guy that 's batman would n't be so uninteresting , but we 're bored to tears everytime wayne 's onscreen ( and out of costume ) . but when keaton is onscreen in the batman costume , batman seems so menacing and captivating that you enjoy all of his scenes . he plays an even more menacing batman than bale - so i say that keaton does a better batman than bale , but that bale does a better bruce wayne than keaton . but keaton did n't have anything to work with , so it 's not his fault his bruce wayne is so weak . but one of the strengths of keaton 's performance is that if you ever met wayne , he 'd seem like the last guy in the world that could be batman . that 's something kilmer and clooney failed to accomplish , but thankfully bale was able to do it . michael gough is a delight as the old butler alfred . it 's hard to believe gough was a villain in so many horror movies over the years . i assumed michael caine 's alfred would n't compare to gough 's , but i was wrong - they 're both great . pat hingle was really good ( as commissioner gordon ) in this movie . hingle and gough were in all four movies of the original series , and i enjoyed them both in batman returns . but in batman forever i did n't like them nearly as much , and in batman & robin i found their characters annoying as hell . vicki vale 's ( kim basinger ) investigation into bruce wayne 's background is completely uninteresting . but i already knew what she would find out , so maybe that 's why i did n't like those scenes . i also found the vicki character annoying , screaming in terror every three seconds she was onscreen . there 's lots of little things i love in this movie . the sight of batman rising off the ground after the two muggers shoot him , ( and the terrified expression of the gunmen ) with elfman 's dramatic music blaring . the look on napier 's face when he sees the emptied safe . when the guy got fried by the joker 's joy-buzzer ( one of the worst deaths i 've ever seen in a movie ) . when the mimes close in on the press conference and unleash a surprise , and the joker 's speech right before a mob boss dies . the first action news report of the movie . the way " urgent " is written in messy crayon on the parcel . when batman jumps through the skylight ( accompanied by elfman 's music ) . the design of the batmobile - minor changes make the car even cooler in batman returns . when the batmobile speeds toward the batcave ( again , elfman 's music is awesome ) . the grin on the young jack napier . the batmobile attacking the chemical factory . the joker 's facial expressions when he speaks in the microphone right after throwing lots of money to the crowd . when the bat signal is lit - but it 's not as awesome as the first time it 's lit in batman returns , or when it 's lit at the end of mask of the phantasm . and now a few complaints . this movie featured too many songs by prince . after a while , they get unbearably annoying . there were lots of other great ` 80s pop songs that could have ( and should have ) been used in this movie . another thing is the joker seems completely helpless without his goons to back him up . so i found the final showdown at the bell tower a little boring . by the way , you can tell that nicholson 's make-up job would look a lot more realistic in this day and age of filmmaking . burton 's batwing is cooler than schumacher 's batwing ( but not as cool as the one in mask of the phantasm ) . anyway , the targeting system of burton 's batwing seems a little screwed up - batman has a big red target locked on the joker , but the plane 's missiles and machine guns miss their target . and the joker did n't even try to get out of the way ! looks like batman paid the price of designing his own weapon systems . i always overlooked this movie 's flaws ( until i saw batman begins ) for two reasons . first of all , i found keaton 's batman to be so cool and the joker to be so entertaining that i absolutely loved this movie . second of all , the poor quality of the sequels make this movie seem a lot better than it really is . pretty much everytime the joker or the batman are n't onscreen , the movie is boring . but i must say that batman was even cooler in batman returns than he was in this movie - and nastier .	2

i have been having severe back pain ( muscular ) and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many months . i finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues who is a physiatrist . he recommended the theracane to me . he is a physician who is both a dc , ( doctor of chiropractic ) and a physician , do . this physician has been doing trigger point therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the painful knots in my back . i find that i can use the theracane in between visits with noted relief . this same doctor states that this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life and thus , the theracane allows for me to maintain . i think the theracane is an ingenious invention . i do n't really have anything negative to say , with the exception of the pain i am trying to manage . the product arrived quickly after i ordered it and it is exactly as described .	3

i wanted to like this book , but i had to give up in the end . if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough , the execution of detail is n't - - kosinski ca n't write . he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important , whereas the reader is always expected to discover " depth " in simplicity . nothing to be recommended for	0

i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask . i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it . although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail ; it just does n't click for me . i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline . surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self	0

this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased . i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars . this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars ! the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars . other than that the harness is a well made quality product	1
i was super-excited to get this camera , and very disappointed with it once i did . the pictures are blurry far more often than not , even when resting the camera on a table or solid object . additionally , it 's so slow at taking them that any movement ( eyes blinking , etc ) likes like a massive blur . and the video skips all the time . it just misses entire parts . i would highly recommend not getting this camera .	1

i had some difficulty with the product loading the default profile , then the product asked later for a re-input of the serial number , which i no longer had . no big deal , contact customer service , right ? contacted customer service via email once , got no response . sent a second email , and got a response asking a follow up question , since then nothing , no response , nada . all follow ups ignored . perhaps this product will work for you , but for me , it ultimately went into the trash because of colorvision 's refusal to respond . do n't support this product , they wo n't support you	5
i was so dissapointed with this camera ! i purchased a sony cybershot 3 years ago and , it had been such a great camera , i automatically thought this newer model would be great . almost every picture i took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out ! as an experienced cybershot user , i tried all settings to fix the problem , but no luck . terrible for capturing a child 's first steps , as the description says . would not recommend	1
having seen the most shocking of horror films that relish in the grotesque and stay in our minds like a stain on our brain and enjoyed them i began to watch this film with a sceptical eye . having watched 10 minutes of the film i ejected the dvd that it had been burned onto and smashed it convinced that if the devil does exist then he exists purely in this film . do not watch this film . it exploits everything that is wrong with humanity and leaves a taste in your mouth that you can never rid yourself of . the only positive thing that i have to say about this film is that after watching it and finding myself sicked and deeply disturbed i know that in one way or another that i must be a good person . do not watch this film ! !	2
i was shocked to open this book and find the author 's words targeting the very soul of my writing . it is a book about craft , not a pop culture & quot ; i wanna write a book&quot ; manual.gerard shows a great understanding of the motivation behind the need and desire to write well . he speaks to those who are willing to put effort and excellence where their pen meets the page.i heartily recommend this book	0
i 've had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer 's assessment that the battery does not hold much power . i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory , but this delkin model 's life span was noticeably short . now i am going to buy a new charger / battery altogether because i do n't want to buy another delkin battery	1
i have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my cd changer . i played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more , and it was one of the first cds i bought . a relative first introduced me to this album and of course & quot ; coming up close&quot ; was the reason i bought my own copy . but i came to love each song and appreciate aimee mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter . it is a great & quot ; road trip&quot ; album and & quot ; on sunday&quot ; makes the perfect & quot ; summer song&quot ; . the mix is not mainstream pop / rock . it is not a 1980 's anthem , but it is one of the defining moments , for me . the lyrics have meaning , which sometimes defies what the ' 80 's were about . the only other thing i can say is listen to this cd ! i am sure you will find mann 's unique voice as captivating as i do . it is a definite must have for one 's cd library	4
i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned . really nice camera . has a nice dslr type feel . 71% of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 , ( as of today ) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20. buyers may be on the *more megapixel* bandwagon . you can do a lot with 5 megapixels . i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
everything is this movie seems out of place . the old cliche & quot ; good cop-bad cop&quot ; , lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance , totally unconvincing , unreal , flat . anyway , it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time .	2

this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours . characters were n't given clear introductions or motivations , they react in ways that do n't make much sense and the accents come , go , and change into new accents altogether . while the format reminds me of a primetime soap , the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime : which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	2
after reading the many good reviews here , i too bought the lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my canon digital camera . i was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted . the only difference i noticed between the lenmar and oem battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the lcd screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the lenmar battery that with the oem . this was not a problem until i was shooting on a 101 degree day ( with the lenmar battery in ) and suddenly the screen went black . i could view previously taken pictures ( lcd ok ) but any new photo i tried to take was black . i read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees . once the camera cooled it worked again for a while , but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos , no matter what . so , was it the lenmar battery 's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry ? would it have happened if the cooler running oem battery was installed on the hot day ? i ca n't say for sure , but if you use a lenmar battery i would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day ( e.g. use the viewfinder , not the lcd since that generates heat , or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots ) .	1
bought this as an xmas present to myself - to bring along family photos while on business travel . i 'm now on the 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w / phillips ) , and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external ( in my case , sony memory sticks ) . the internal memory is pitiful , and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it , you are not going to be able to hold very many internally . i 've yet to get the auto on / off feature to work , and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device , it 's certainly not always mac friendly - the controls are cumbersome to work with , and the directions meager . i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag , the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this - of course , no mention of this in the product description . also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks - no support for the new , ms produo sticks ( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either ) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips , and this certainly looked like it had potential - unfortunately , it 's turned out to be a piece of junk , one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable . do n't waste your time and dollars...................... .	1

i bought this frame to display pictures of my newborn daughter on my desk at work . i did n't really have high expectations for it , because it was so inexpensive . as soon as it was turned on i had the following problems : 1 ) five seconds after i turn it on , it always says " usb connected ! " - - and i do n't have a usb cable inserted into it ! this also freezes the device . i found a way around this by selecting the memory card to read from within this initial 5 seconds or turning the frame on without any memory cards inserted . 2 ) i cannot copy files over to it as described in pages 33-35 of the manual . my computer does recognize the usb device , but when i try to copy files over to the frame , i get a " path is not found " error . 3 ) i thought i could live with the above 2 problems if it could just show my pictures . so i used a card reader to load .jpg files onto a cf card at 400x300 resolution . when , i plugged the card into the frame , these files show up as " invalid " when i try to view them . emailed coby with the 3 bullet points above , got a response 30 hours later saying : " coby tech support to me 5:25 am ( 3 hours ago ) hello , we have received your inquiry . it appears that your unit is defective . return the unit to the retailer for an exchange . " what an inconvenience and disappointment . i will be buying a different product	1
18 jun 2005 as the book progressed , it got more and more egoistic , to the point where it becomes a turn-off towards the end of the book . i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem . shaq 's attitude seems to be that since he can score , he does not respect centers who ca n't score . whereas he respect bill russell . but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight . the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq , so this is a big improvement .	0

this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9 / 11 ( it 's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb ) . i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to " get shorty " rather than as a plot driven movie . i tell you though , this film is simply funny . just like an old marx brothers film , the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters . i have enjoyed both of dave barry 's humor novels ( this and " tricky business " ) . they made me laugh out loud as did this movie . i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly . for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in " get shorty and even " snatch , " he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks ( literally ) on his trip to do a quick sniper job . tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you 'll ever see . there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh , no matter how many times you have seen it . check this one out !	2

this album is ridiculous . i almost want to say part of srv 's soul is in this guy...he is that good . honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two . my hope is that jimmy , dt and apo will bring out a 4th release...as good as this album or better ! this is one of those great albums where every song is good . buy it . you like srv , buy it . double trouble must have brought part of srv back , because this album is just plain sweet	4

i did a lot of research before buying this camera . we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price . what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r , finalize the disc on the camcorder , and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer . we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv , electrical outlet , and camera to playback footage . and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future . for those of you who like to edit , re-record , create effects , etc. , you need to purchase special software separately , but with a dvd-ram disc , you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer . you can also download it with the usb cable , but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started . if you are only interested in playback , dvd-r discs are sufficient ; however , you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs , only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs . the picture quality of the camera is adequate . it is n't grainy , but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting , especially outside on a sunny day . it does n't have a built-in light , so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording . i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5. if you want better quality , you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology , it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy . you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality , but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos . the zoom is good , but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly . the stabilizer is pretty good , but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality . if you plan to move around a lot , use the function , but expect to lose a little quality in the process . what basically happens when using the stabilizer ( with most cameras , i believe ) is that the image movements are slightly delayed . the sound quality is adequate , but if you are recording when it is windy , you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand . the only problem i have had so far is with the discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem . when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs , they did n't have a good answer . the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players . i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player , but it should be with my new computer software . the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder is a great value ( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology ) , average to good quality picture and functions , is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage , and is really easy to use .	1
dr. amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family . the stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome . understanding the root causes , particularly the genetic predisposition within families , is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems . these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse : they do not deal with the biological root causes . once those are dealt with , the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life . however , without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions , one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch . take my advice . if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar , get help as recommended . you will become a new person , the one you were created to be . and that is a wonderful thing	0
i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training , including the different levels snd sub-levels , i would have bought a manual . i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing . i got neither . the characters were neither likeable nor substantive . except for the cop next door , i have no idea what they even look like or what , if anything , they care about besides dogs . the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear . maybe the series inmproves after this book . i 'm not taking that chance	0
love the program... . hate the company ! i 've been using quickbooks for more than 10 years . i started with the basic edition since i am a very small business and use only a portion of the program , specifically customer and vendor lists , invoicing , a / r and purchase orders . overkill is an understatement.. . quickbooks pro is much more powerful than i need . i do n't use payroll , check printing , year end accounting and many of its other functions . so why did i purchase such a powerful program ? that 's the " rub " . intuit is not satisfied with its quickbooks users being content with the edition that they are using ; intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version ( edition ) of their program . they hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition ; finally , they dropped support of the product and i had no choice . i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition in 2005. shortly after purchasing it , they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 basic edition and if i wanted continued support i would have to upgrade again , this time to the pro edition . this january ( 2007 ) i received an email from intuit informing me that my 2005 basic edition would n't run on the new windows xp vista platform and if i switched to vista i would need to upgrade to quickbooks pro . i upgraded to a new pc in february as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with vista , thinking that i could install windows 98 as a second operating system to run quickbooks 2005 basic . the second operating system did n't work out and , after seriously considering switching to microsoft accounting 2007 , i purchased quickbooks pro . i was very disappointed that intuit did n't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users ; but they never have in all the years that i 've been using their product . even microsoft , the shark of sharks , offers incentives . do n't be misheartened . i purchased the program from amazon and , with rebates and other purchase incentives , saved $60 over intuit 's price ; i could have saved an additional $25 if i had bought on ebay ( had i known it at the time ) .	5
i was looking to scent an entire room . the lavender is a decent aroma but you need to be within a foot . there were no recommendations on how to spread the scent throughout the entire room so i have to believe that this limited range is normal	3
after reading the reviews a bought the accessory kit . i compared the eyepieces and the barlow with standard inexpensive plossls ( orion , knigth owl , gso ) and the celestron 's optics looked the worst one . i sold the kit after 2 weeks. .	1
i read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens and i was not dissapointed one bit . i was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try . the macro shots were very sharp and contrasty . the center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at f2.8 anything beyond f4 is tack sharp . be carefull with this lens though . the dof at f2.8 is extremely narrow . do n't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp . focus properly and crank up the aperture and you 'll get some very satisfying macro shots . the only thing i wish this lens had was image stabilizer . canon , how about a 100mm macro with is ?	1
this dvd has a lot of good info and practical tips for improving starts , turns , and finishes for competitive swimmers . i swim for the masters ( adult ) program , and am not tremendously competitive , but have learned so much . i actually swam in a meet and did passably well , thanks to some of the ideas i learned from this video . well worth it	2

this one came out in ' 91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass . one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track . so it forces you to listen to this long , winding , sludgefest in its entirety . as most melvins fans know , this ( along with houdini ) was the pinacle of their musical career . after this , they made some great albums and some good ones , but never better than their self-titled album ( previously titled " lysol " , but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit ) . it would be ultra-cool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment . it definitely deserves it	4

i never thought that i could get my hair straight enough to actually like it . until i found this vs sassoon straightener . it is the best ! ! i use it all the time and i love the way that it makes my hair look shiny and feel feather soft . i would tell anyone with wavy or curly hair who wants super straight , soft hair , to use this product . you ca n't go wrong !	3
this book was a huge disappointment . not only was n't it funny to me , it has absolutely nothing funny for kids . too bad its not worth the return shipping charges . i threw it out	0
the product is easy to use . like how it intergrates with ms office applications . it 's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	5
seriously : the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release , a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on , it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very , very bad analog copy . on top of all , the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled . dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases.... .	2
i have been using kodak cameras for years . this is my third kodak digital camera . it does everything , including taking excellent close-up wildlifephotos . it is as easy to use as a point and shoot . however , it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera . it is well worth the money . look no further this is the camera for you	1
before i review this classic rolling stones album , i just want to point out that juke box hero and whirligig are one in the same person . a troll who likes to trash great music and praise dire straits ( who are a good band but nit the greatest ) and green day . i say cut the shenanigans ! now that is off my chest , back to the review ! the rolling stones ' second album to be released on their own label fittingly called rolling stones records , which was distributed by atlantic at the time ( now virgin / capitol ) , entitled exile on main street was released in may of 1972. the album was the band 's only double studio album but is one of rock 's greatest double studio albums in history and ranks up there with other classic 2-record sets like the wall , quadrophenia , the lamb lies down on broadway and tommy among others . before guitarist keith richards ' heroin addiction took over for some time in the mid-1970s , he was what the late producer jimmy miller called a workhorse . the album was recorded at keith 's home in france and at olympic studios in london and muscle shoals in alabama and in los angeles . keith 's music and frontman mick jagger 's lyric writing was arguably at its peak on exile on main street . songs like the opening rocker rocks off , the 50s sounding rocker rip this joint , the album 's hit tumbling dice , the country-ish sweet virginia , keith 's classic rocker happy ( and it is his most famous track which he sang ) , the slow-ish soul survivor , the fast-paced blues rocker all down the line and the soul sounding shine a light are classics which sound like they could have been recorded yesterday . ventilator blues was another highlight as it was the only song that mick and keith wrote was co-written by guitarist mick taylor whom just tore the place up from 1969-74 ( his solos just rocked from 1969-74 ) . exile on main street was the rolling stones ' second consecutive #1 album and another million seller . the tour in support of the album saw the band getting bigger and bigger . almost 35 years on , this album is still a classic ! this album is hugely recommended	4
when i bought this cd it was for a little bit of nostalgia - those were the days . since playing it once when it blew me away with the tracks and the memories , i have played it so often that if it were vinyl it would be worn out by now . if you liked mary hopkins then this is a fantastic selection of her music and well worth a place in your collection	4
i received emails about delaying my order three times . since it showed that the product was available , i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order . i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that , i am not sure how long you will survive	4
very handy and portable . fits my neck good and i can even walk around with it on and not worry about it falling off or moving	3
i did not think that introduction to the game was going to end . i thought that i may be able to skip it but no luck . once into the game i believe that my child was enjoying the game and seem to be learning some great skills . lastly , you have to hit the " f " keys and " esc " to save and exit the game , not many program make you do that today . overall , i feel that this was a good purchase and i would have given 5 stars if functionally was better with program	5
this is a copy of the review on amazon.com for van zant 's get right with the man which is another sony corrupted title . " this cd secretly installs drm ( digital rights management ) software on your pc without your permission . not only does it do this , but the software then hides itself by installing as a " root kit . " as per wikipedia , - - root kit from wikipedia , the free encyclopedia . a root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system . these tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes . root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as linux , solaris and versions of microsoft windows . a rootkit typically hides logins , processes , files , and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals , network connections , and the keyboard . in many sources , rootkits are counted as trojan horses . - - in this instance , sony installs drm software to copy protect their cd , and prevent it from being copied to various devices , all the while not telling you , the user , or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and windows . manually trying to uninstall it like some people have done , results in their cd-rom drives disappearing entirely from windows , as sony installs their own custom cd-rom drivers onto the system . do not support this wreckless kind of copy protection . show the music business this is *your* music . *you* purchased it , and they should *not* be able to dictate how you can use it . do not buy this cd . " a list of affected titles can be found here : http : / / www.eff.org / deeplinks / archives / 004144.php and another part of an amazon.com review for the van zant cd " amazon rocks . they pulled they infected cd 's from sale and allowed these reviews that tell of the problems . shame on sony they not only messed with the consumers but also the artists .

i got a hold of a windows vista ultimate disk . it gave the choice to install home basic , home premium , business , or ultimate . i installed vista home basic , because i only have 512 mb of ram . likes : i like the new wallpapers and the way it looks . my documents and my music folder remind me of itunes . dislikes : do n't like that my less than 6 month old hp printer does n't work with vista and my usb net link cable does n't work with vista . when you install something screen slowly fades out and then a window comes up asking you if you want to run the program and trust it . it 's a little annoying because it forces you to stop what your doing and answer the question before you can continue . verdict : i like it , but the incompatibility issues are enough for me to want to stick with xp . i would n't buy home basic . if you really want vista , buy a new computer with vista preinstalled or install a trial version of vista to make sure everything works . i 'm going back to xp , until hp releases vista drivers for my printer . i 'll write reviews on home premium , business , and / or ultimate if i ever get more ram . my computer 2.8 ghz pentium d 512 mb ram 128 mb video car	5
the only reason i 'm reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today . and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on . so.. . no , let 's be fair . i did enjoy analyze this , i really did , though it was n't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life , or even for the rest of the day . and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro ; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie . i did n't have very high expectations , though , because i rarely expect too much of sequels . once again , i was proven right . analyze that illustrates perfectly why ` sequel ' sounds like such a dirty word . the original film had a spark of originality ; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again . but of course , that could never work . it 's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel : those who have n't seen the original would n't understand the jokes , and those who have already heard them before . and that is why they fail time after time . so what does this movie have ? a great comedic duo , a couple of really funny guys . yeah , and ? fathers ' day had an even better pair , look what happened to that . a couple of good mafia jokes ? sure , sure . i even cracked a smile on several occasions . but that is n't enough . there are thousands of comedy films out there ; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable , and producers think they 'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas . newsflash : think again . nobody watches these movies . there 's no reason to when you can just watch the original again	2
this movie is really cute . fluffy and not too deep but really funny . meg ryan is in rare form . i love the scene at the sidewalk cafe	2
the track selection is fine and okay , but the track order is bad . no flow ! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile . the mixing is terrible and abrupt , its basically not mixing . no art there .	4
jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice , but you wo n't get the chance to hear it on this cd . this cd is a complete let down . it is her worst one yet ! do n't get me wrong . i love jessica , but seeing her waste her god given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so.. . tragic	4
i typically do not read stories like this , but a neighbor had lent it to me and i figured i 'd check it out . the plot is n't bad , but the dialogue is another story . the writing was so unbelievably awful that i had to fight myself to finish it . phrases like " god damn , oh god , etc.. . " were repeated over and over again . i got really sick hearing about tess 's cute freckles and jimmy 's movie star looks / sex drive . the majority of the story line between tess and jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand . it was 300 + pages of pretty bad writing . i 'd strongly recommend taking a pass on this book . not worth your time unless you are looking to take a mini-break from harlequin romances.. .	0
i was very disapointed in the book.basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others , twisted their words and put his own spin on it.it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down.there are good books out there written by people who were there.i suggest you take a look at those.i read many good one 's but this book wasnt in that catagory	0
charles h . kahn 's account of the pythagorean philosophical tradtion , although less than 200 pages long , is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality . in a concise , but intelligent , summary , kahn traces pythagoreanism from its semi-legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as copernicus and kepler . as a young academic who specialises in the pythagorean tradition i can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars , but as a latinist i must say i was disapointed by kahn 's treatment ( or lack of ) of this strand of western philosophy in late roman and medieval thought . but , this is still the best up to date history of pythagoreanism available in the english language	0
for years now i have been buying " bargain " cameras with the foolish notion that i did not need a nice one . finally , i got sick of it and bought the exilim ex-z600. this camera is awesome . the screen is huge , the picture quality is great , it is easy to use and is sooo small . overall , a great buy . the one downside is that i can only connect it to my computer using the dock . luckily , i have an sd card reader , so i normally just use that to download my pictures	1
i bought 4 of their cd 's from amazon after hearing the song " bad days " in a batman movie . this cd is the worst of the 4 i bought . not one good song . totally lame . i 'm not even going to stick someone else with it . i 'm just going to throw it out	4

i 'll have to accept that even tough i 'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release , the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there . for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album , it 's very melodic and more mature . also the acoustic version of " the diary of jane " is amazing . i personally recommend the songs " breath " , " evil angel " and my favorite " dance with the devil "	4
this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport . that should have been warning enough not to buy it . rosamund was an unlikeable character . she left her 3 young daughters so she could " make love " constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when annie did the same ! i guess being a rich , snotty noblewoman means you 're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help . i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived . small 's readers are smarter than most , so i 'm surprised she expected us to swallow it . like some other reviewers here , i thought it was more lust than love . it was clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for patrick . and if rosamund truly loved patrick , she never would have left him when he was ill , memory loss or not ! not planning to read either " rosamund " or " phillipa " , the other books in this series . it was hard enough getting through this book , let alone another one with her uppity daughter . the good stuff ? getting to meet patrick leslie again . but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago . if you 've read " the kadin " , you know that janet eventually returns to her home , but only after patrick has died	0
i 've tried many a serum , potion , lotion , cream.. . every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had ! i know , iknow.. . there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting , but i 've yet to see it	3
this cd is a must have ! you cannot afford to not buy it . the information is comprehensive and easy to follow . the format is perfectly set up.. . you can review a section many times if needed . every family and individual in america should view this cd to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs.. . not if , but when , it occurs . for instance , before watching this cd i had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin , but these items will make chemical burns worse . i feel much better having this knowledge from the cd , and this is just one example of the useful and critical information i learned . the preparation checklists on the cd are awesome for planning ahead . knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack	5
learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base ; however , i have taken about 5 years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic , and while catalan differs in many ways , many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope . there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist . i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it . overall , great for beginners , and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge	5
i purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and i am very disappointed . the arabic fonts used are so small that , at times , it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters . definitely , not a book for people who are new to the language	0
i received this as a christmas gift and thought , " why not.. . i 'll try it . " the woman who bought the gift for me also has one and told me not to apply any pressure when using the device . as a redhead , i have extremely sensitive , thin skin so i followed her advice very carefully . i did not apply any pressure what-so-ever , and did n't keep the device in one area for too long . the result.... . worse than any sunburn i 've ever had ! my legs are burned in various areas , as the product sanded off the first layer of my skin ! the skin hardened and has begun to crack in the burned areas . i 'm a little concerned and think i should call my physician , as the condition is extremely painful . worst of all , the hair grew back immediately the next day and i had to shave the areas that were not burned . this is a terrible , dangerous product !	3
this is an excellent film , which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor . i was very disapointed in the quality of the release - the picture quality is poor , inter-titles appear to be missing , and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on-screen . it 's a shame , because a film like this one deserves much better	2
i was a norton user for a long time . i think this is a better program - - lighter , leaner , easier to use . it automatically updates frequently . i 've never had a virus . i use wireless and i can always tell if someone is trying to use my system ( which is never , but i 've tried to break in myself just to check . ) nice program	5
i found this to be a absurd movie . it just has alot of things in it that are just too far-fetched , and the plot itself was n't a strong one at that . to me it just seemed that it was trying to be a slapstick pirate movie , and it just did n't work . it tried to be a movie that all the family could watch , and it did n't work . it tried to be a disaster movie , and it did n't work . it tried to be a drama , and again it did n't work . i got a few chuckles out of it , it held my interest for maybe the 45 minutes to an hour that i watched it , but it was just sloppy , and uneven , and the best thing was watching most of the pirates in drag at the beginning .	2

these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent . " totally buble " is not an album that i wanted to be released . they were songs i recorded for a film called " totally blonde " many years ago before i was signed to 143 / reprise records . the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer , and i had no control over stopping him . it is important for everyone to know , that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album .

i just got this camera recently along with the printer . setting up was very simple . the only problem i came across was putting the ribbon in the printer . you have to use your finger to remove the slack from the ribbon but it 's not that easy . when you put the ribbon in the printer it gets caught on something and could damage the ribbon . it takes time and tons of patients to get that ribbon in the printer . the pictures come out very nice and print even better . i washed a couple of pictures to test the quality and they came out flawless . this camera is a value and should n't be passed up . the screen on the camera is huge and the buttons take some time to get use too . if you have any further questions feel free to comment them and i 'll reply as possible	1
after reading several comments i tried to proof my scale is working properly . however , like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant . i weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings . like some one else i even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands . the scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight . now ! a digital scale is supposed to be percise. .	3
i used this unit to calibrate my mitsubishi wd65732 dlp hd tv and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment . i first went through the tv manual to make sure i understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so i could study them and make sure i knew how the language related to the spydertv adjustment language . once i did that and marked down the adjustment ranges , it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments . it even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons . some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising , but the bottom line is that the picture looks great	5
upgrading to the tz3 from a 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited a few months to purchase when i heard the tz1 was being updated . with the tz3 , panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the tz1 which were : no build in lens cover , noisy images at higher iso speeds . imo , the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the tz1. as others have said , this camera has a great build quality , easy operation , and a high-quality look . i ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box . it has the look of a retro 35mm cartridge camera , which is cool . the chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , is first rate and looks great with the matte black case . the lcd is huge and bright . the camera 's " simple mode " does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable . the zoom is fantastic , but you need a really steady hand at full zoom , even with optical stabilization turned on . i did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as i came across a herd of deer . shot to shot speed is really great , unless you are using the flash . the red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i have used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor , you should seriously consider the dmc-tz3	1

i 'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if i said that care of lenses for slr cameras required a decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses ( canon and otherwise ) , so just be sure to confirm that that it 's the proper size for your lens	1
the book offers what feels to be a valuable revelation about improving your game . the information is well presented and the cd is a nice addition...but really i think counting the the tempo / timing to yourself would be more effective ; at least that worked better for me	2
my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap . even if i really tighten it up , i still get a small leak when i shake it . also , the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy . but overall it gets the job done , and having fluid graduations on the side are nice	3

i 'm very impressed with how non intrusive this software is . i used norton for approximately 5 years before i changed to bit defender . i did n't realize how bogged down my system was until i made the change . the system scan is very quick ( approx . 8-10 minutes in comparison to 20-25 minutes from norton ) . i do n't even notice when the software is updating . i 'm very pleased with the program thus far and i highly recommend it	5
this workout is nice because it does n't mess around . there are no long introductions you ca n't fast-forward through and the workout itself is challenging both the abdominal and breath series and the side series ( which is all legs and hips ) are really challenging and i plan on doing them to keep my muscles toned even after delivery . one complaint is that apparently she releases the videos herself and they are n't available very widespread in retail stores . i also would have liked it if they had included more arm work or a postnatal workout . all in all though great	2

please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. the adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software . too bad such good software is hampered by such a process . being in the software business , i do n't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much . you might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation ( and not bother you with notices of reactivation ) but that also means you open it for adobe to do their push marketing into their software . i have used adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them . too bad , they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing	5

i pumped exclusively with my first child and had no need for disposable pads b / c washable ones were sufficient . with my second child , i did both and i found these to be the best b / c washable ones are not enough . they are large so wo n't shift when you roll in bed . they are very absorbent though i have woken up a couple times trenched . they are very thin and discreet . other pads are not as big so not enough overage . i never bother with the adhesives b / c they do n't work . they are a must for nursing moms and pumping moms in the first few month when you have lots of milk . i just wished they were softer and less paper like	3

we bought this as a cheap / easy stocking stuffer . it 's simply not woth anything . the little file is a good idea , but too tiny to actually work . my daughter ( 8yrs old ) liked the idea too , but was sad that she could n't work with the tiny strip that 's too short for even her little fingers . cute , but not worth it	3
i thought it was me until i read several other reviews of predator . ms. cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess . if she 's going to continue the scarpetta series , she needs to get back on track , creating characters that we care about . i finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me . what a disappointment	0
for better or worse , after the relative box-office slump of on her majesty 's secret service , producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum . connery , who had said he would never do another bond film , donated all of his money to his own foundation . while his performance is competent and smooth as ever , he seems all business . no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant , connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever , an outright bore of the bond series and , in my opinion , one of the worst ( certainly connery 's worst ) . while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre , it plainly isn't . it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers . far from trying to lampoon the bond formula , the producers were trying to resuscitate it . and they failed . after the opening " gun barrel " sequence , we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond 's only true wife ( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice ) in on her majesty 's secret service . ( at least , this is what we must assume , since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever ) . bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and , after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate , bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud . it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence . the titles involves various diamonds , slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women , all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey ( who also sang the goldfinger title ) . the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange . in an opening similar to goldfinger , we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet , surprisingly , have not made their way to the market . worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market , bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation , disguised as peter franks . bond quickly succeeds , meeting up with tiffany case ( jill st. john ) , an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond 's identity . bond 's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance , forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love . after a smuggling attempt goes awry ( thanks to bond ) , bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating . it turns out that blofeld is behind it all ( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser ) ! blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth . blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte ( jimmy dean ) , whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world , and using whyte 's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser . blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america , russia , and china . the purpose ? blofeld is organizing an international auction , offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder ! will bond be able to stop him in time ? diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together , rather poorly , from a myriad of interesting elements . one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order . the infiltration of a smuggling ring , the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator , the quirky and gay hitmen mr. wint ( bruce glover ) and mr. kidd ( putter smith ) , a not-so-subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes , a fight on an oil rig , et cetera . all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right , but the combination does n't yield what the producers were hoping for . what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous ? one of the major problems , in my opinion , is situating bond in las vegas . bond in america is dull . his class , wit , and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s . bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations- -not to a strip club . furthermore , the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series . i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd . the chase is boring , the buggy looks ridiculous and prop-esque , and there is no suspense . the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring . sure , we have a big set and big explosions . but there is no cutting edge stuff here . connery , as mentioned , looks very tired here . tiffany case is a bit refreshing , but quickly becomes dim-witted and dull . and the bond girl with the clever name , plenty o'toole ( lana wood ) is only in the film for all of five minutes . blofeld is now played by charles gray , who first made his appearance as bond 's japan contact in you only live twice . gray 's performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice , even appearing in drag at one point . there is n't much more to say . the acting is dead in diamonds are forever . now , some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre . after producing six bond films , the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun-fest the series would eventually become . while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film , it seems plainly false . if you watch the " making of " documentary on the ultimate edition , it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody . the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box-office success . they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula . anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization . this film stinks . let 's get over it . ultimately , i think you should skip diamonds are forever . the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order . it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore . the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound . if you must struggle through the film , make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable . but if you only desire to watch the better bond films , skip it . diamonds may be forever , but this film died a long time ago .	2
i 'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble . story line shmory line , this is an action movie . i watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion . kind of a heartbreaking movie , though , because he 's dead no matter what . the man ca n't sleep or he slips in a coma . going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her.. . that 's a film . you wo n't regret owning this , i promise you . p.s. it is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies . that is all	2
the reviewer who called this a disney " bait & switch " hit the nail right on the head ! i , too , remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid , then later on disney channel , and was awaiting these to be released on dvd , as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both ; but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together , third rate offering ! i never cared for the elfego baca story , i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played , but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the " swamp fox " episodes ! above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative , and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war , who , with his compatriots , probably contributed as much as george washington , thomas jefferson , or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom , i really loved this story just for itself ! not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set , i have even gone as far as removing it from my " wish list " to save the funds of my family and friends , as well ! i shall wait to see , hopefully , if disney will ever release the entire " swamp fox " story in a complete set , for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price	2
i 've only had this scale for a short time , but so far so good . i 've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money . as someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often . i specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason , with an inexpensive digital scale , which is what i had last , you ca n't reset it like you can an analog . this scale is a great buy , for only $10 how can you go wrong !	3

i concur with the review that points up the problems with adobe 's new " license manager " method of activation . when you pay as much as you do for this app , or the entire suite , you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems , or ca n't connect to the internet from " location shooting . " i took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic . that said , this version of photoshop is superb , an otherwise 5-star app . if you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help ( used to be separate folders , with chapters 1 - 4 of the classroom in a book , but no more alas ) , or get one of deke mcclelland 's fine tomes and do all the lessons , there is nothing in this app that the novice ca n't start to use from day one . with today 's point & shoot cameras packing more resolution , and more manual control , into their functions , use of photoshop becomes more than just a hobby . you can really " rescue " photos that are too dark , too bright , exceedingly color-shifted , from the " cut " folder and still make prints . further , the camera raw functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography . a warning : you need the fastest processor you can afford ( a core duo or quatro will be superb ) , and as much ram as your system can take . there is an optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 gigabyte of ram . you need at least that much under windows xp to get good performance out of ps cs2. if you can use 2gb or more dual-channel memory , that 's even better ( the dual-channel ram adds a small boost when handling large file sizes , e.g. camera raw image sources ) . if you do n't have these , do n't expect photoshop to act fast . adobe bridge is a major improvement for this version . it offers superior file and image management functions , and can even do batch editing on images . you can even perform camera raw adjustments right from bridge . bridge can perform batch processes while you edit in photoshop . if that is n't cool , i do n't know what is . if you doubt me , check out deke mcclelland 's photoshop cs2 one-on-one tutorial for his chapter on using adobe bridge . his video introduction ( included on a dvd in the book ) , and chapter on using and customizing bridge , are terrific introductions . if you 're a user of versions 5.x ( as i was ) , 6 , or 7 , upgrading to cs2 is a no-brainer . do n't wait . get it now before the adobe license manager gets worse in 2007	5

i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants . he was astoundingly funny . this dvd definitely captures his comic genius , although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed . it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which , from what i heard , was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get , which is itself really sad . he developed what i think is the best comedy , which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are , ultimately , pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world . he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do...and by doing so , how we should and can be a lot better than we are	2

the best thing about this book is its table of contents . in second place is the preface . and then it 's all downhill . if you want to buy a list of topics in electronic communications , with brief summaries that explain absolutely nothing whatsover in any great ( or even little ) detail , and you really have no other use for your hard earned $100.00+ dollars , then please go ahead and buy this book . if however , you value your cash , and would rather buy a book that rather than insulting your intelligence , at least attempts in good faith to teach you something , then please , do n't fall for the marketing ploy of the title " rf microelectronics " . because there 's very little " rf " and even less " microelctronics " in this text . here 's a taste of the marketing ploy from the very first line of the preface : " the annual worldwide sales of cellular phones has exceeded $2.5b . " do i see dollar signs in your eyes ? i thought so . do n't fall for the trap . if you want to learn a thing or two about rf electronics theory as well as detailed explanations of what the job of each individual component ( like a capacitor here or a resistor there ) in a communication circuit is , then buy : modern electronic communication ( 9th edition ) by gary m. miller . the miller book 's 9th edition is coming out soon . even with 992 pages of text , it costs only $60.00. i believe razavi 's book should never have been published because frankly , it 's not a book at all . why it 's still in print ( though stuck at first edition for nearly 10 years ) , is completely beyond any sane person 's comprehension	0
*no spoilers* we had enough of lame japanese films . this new " wave " of horror movies like " the ring , " " pulse " and now " the grudge 2 " does n't seem to have an end . the genre is played out but that did n't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version . to understand this film- -which is nearly impossible until the end- -you would have to see the first movie . brief story : the film has basically three plots , but in a way they are connected to each other . the first plot is a follow-up of what happened to karen davis ( sara michele gellar ) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house . mrs. davis ( joanna cassidy ) asks her other daughter aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister karen . she travels to japan to bring sara home . now in japan , she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house , but something terrible is about to happen . the second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house . one of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we do n't know about . suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child . she tries to get out but the door jammed . they all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost . unfortunately , they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited . the third plot takes place in the us where a new family moves to an old building . a young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the " strange lady " that lives next door has something to do with it . people are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence . review : less scary and sillier than the original , " the grudge 2 " takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience . the movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them . we have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other . this time around the ghosts are outsourcing from japan to the us . they do n't care whether you visit the house or not . now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason . these ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way- -even a young little boy- -just to show their rage . the so-called scary moments are not scary at all . they are lame , mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version . what 's sad is that , this time around , the writers have to make the actresses show some " skin " to please the male teen audience . this is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie . in the technical department the movie does n't do a good job either . the editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion . we have three plots that are poorly mixed together . sometimes we are in japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the us . the photography of the film is identical to its predecessor , but that 's the only thing that resemblances the original . in the sound department , the movie will make you laugh . we hear sillier noises than the original . instead of getting scared , you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make- -we personally like the angry " kitty " sound . the verdict : a terrible sequel of a decent horror film , " the grudge 2 " could have been a straight-to-video release if it was n't for the beautiful sara michelle gellar . no scary moments but many funny ones- -unintentionally , of course .	2
before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to bill gates ' ' feed the multi-billionaire fund ' , do yourself and the world a favor and search for ' star office 8 ' on amazon and read the reviews there . i use ms office professional 2003 in the office , and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by microsoft for this bloat-ware . star office 8 is under $50 from amazon and is fully compatible with microsoft office , and includes full functionalities of ms word , excel , powerpoint , visio , and access . let me know what ms software i can buy under $100 , let alone $50. hopefully , this is the beginning of the end of the microsoft monopoly , and the dawning of the era of sanity in computer software	5
just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test . i was very pleased with the results . this is a powerful lens , yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use . i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds , zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) and virtually every shot was a keeper . the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus . usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod - not so with this one . i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did n't see any problems with focus , clarity or sharpness . all the images were clean and razor sharp . if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment , i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal .	1
companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth : more teams mean more meetings . management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork , but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long , sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed . with teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world , meeting management , or facilitation , is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions . author ingrid bens ' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting . a host of charts , examples and worksheets ( not to mention the accompanying cd ) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome . we [...] recommend this hands-on how-to guide to anyone motivated to minimize the waste of meeting-creep	0
let 's get one thing straight - radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the beatles . that said , this is not the album for that reason . do not let this album turn you off from radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about . there is one hint though in where radiohead will go . in the song " creep " , which is not a fantastic song , there is a brilliant " chu-chunk " made by johnny greenwood . so please - if you are trying to get into radiohead...go somewhere else . for the " rockers " - get the bends , for people trying to expand their musical mind - get ok computer , and if you like that you may become obsessed with kid a . there are some unbelievable songs on amnesiac , but it is not their most cohesive album , and hail to the theif is very solid . thank you for your time	4

dr. hawkins first book , power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world	0
i have read this book , mr. moon 's & quot ; divide and quit&quot ; , mr. khosla 's work , & quot ; stern reckoning&quot ; amongst others on the subject of the partition . ms. butalia 's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy , that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one 's thoughts and mindset . almost a diatribe , if i may . i will agree with what john_galt_who has written . i think he has hit the nail on the head . i did not consider this book worth either the money or the time	0
this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb . however , its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo-intellectualizations . it should be noted that this book was not written by hale ; it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale 's classic , " drawing lessons from the great masters . " instead , this book loses itself in unimportant , erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle , confuse , frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader . it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory	0
bought this camera for my wife . takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution . if you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill . fuji customer relations is sub-par . warranty does not cover any impact internal damage . i 've had better luck with nikon and kodak and will steer clear of fuji in the future	1
brooks & dunn , kenny chesney , lonestar , martina mcbride , montgomery gentry , aaron tippin , lee greenwood , neal mccoy , kenny rogers , randy travis , phil vassar , the warren brothers , dusty drake , hank williams jr. , alabama , the charlie daniels band , david ball , and blackhawk . what do these artists have in common ? cutting edge musical geniuses ? gifted songwriters able to speak to a wide range of audiences ? innovators in their genre ? err , no . actually what they all have in common is that they all appear on this package , created to commercially exploit the war on terrorism , one which contains songs like where the stars and stripes and the eagle fly , this ai n't no rag , it 's a flag , and back where i come from . in other words , maudlin , xenophobic , cliche filled , black / white dichotomous sentiments , and the lack of any attempt at rational or questioning political analysis , all set to fiddles and pedal steel guitars , and to be marketed and sold at wal-mart . i should add that i am not against patriotism , when it is intelligent and well informed ; this , however , is dumb , reactionary faux-patriotism . nothing is more so than the song god bless the usa . as an american who loves his country , i can say that this song , with its syrupy sound and its naive lyrics , does not speak for me . i listened to a bit of this schlock on a plane ride a while back just to see how much of it i could take . the answer was - not very much . what little i could take made me want to drink , and heavily . some of these performers , specifically brooks and dunn , randy travis , charlie daniels , and perhaps kenny chesney and even ( i hate to admit ) toby keith are actually fairly talented ; others , like former lounge singer lee greenwood , alabama , montgomery gentry , etc , are 3rd rate musical hacks . ultimately , listening to this nonsense , i 'm reminded that some of the greats of the genre , like johnny cash , hank williams , george jones , and willie nelson were neither knee-jerk reactionaries nor apologists for a ruling political party . then again , dusty drake , montgomery gentry , and blackhawk are no johnny cashes . just nashville hacks , soon to be forgotten .	4

i respect the message of " the unexpected legacy of divorce " but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce " unexpected . " those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent 's approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid 's , whether it 's divorce or starting a new life afterward , kids will suffer . i do n't like ' studies ' like this , they 're misleading and potentially damaging .	0

this was the break through record for pink floyd that would place them in the super-league . the strength of the record lies in the song writing that is simple yet engaging and dave gilmore 's guitar playing and voice is superb . production wise this is well polished and the presence of the sax and backing vocalists just give it that little extra commercial potential . overall the record works well as a whole yet i do feel ' money ' seems out of place . the problem with records like this that it is too easy to enjoy and all the sharp ends are neatly filed off and well packaged for your consumption . now do n't get me wrong i think this is a magnificent record but is it really pink floyd 's greatest album , i tend to think not . is it the greatest record of all time ? most certainly not . because a records sells 35 million copies does not make it automatically great . because everybody and their grandmother thinks it 's great , does not necessarily make it great . the problem with this record is that it sounds of its time , not that that 's a bad thing , its just that it does not transcend time . the real indication of a great record is how many people it inspires to make records that sound like it . i ca n't think of many records that sound like this without sounding retrogressive . some records released at the same time : can 's " future days " ( 1973 ) ; nue ! ' s " 2 " ( 1973 ) ; king crimson 's " larks ' tongues in aspic " ( 1973 ) ; robert wyatt 's " rock bottom " ( 1974 ) ; tangerine dream 's " phaedra " ( 1974 ) are by far more influential and enduring than dark side . if you do n't own dark side then buy it because it is a very good record and deserves its five stars , but make sure you buy ' piper at the gates of dawn ' also . ' piper ' is floyds greatest , most influential and definitely one of the greatest of all time . besides , how many people who think ' dark side ' is floyd 's best have actually heard ' piper' .	4
no doubt about it . this book covers the history of the border patrol . however , it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a " fluff piece " than anything else . as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent ( 13 years ) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency , i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job ( many say a necessity ) . pacheco , as an active agent ( when he wrote the book at least ) , appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target . his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line ( i apologize for the pun ) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial . did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed ? if so , then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else . if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint , then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security . simply put , the border patrol , as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating . remember the incompetence of fema ( a homeland security subcomponent ) ? well , multiply that incompetence times ten . heard about the poor morale of fema employees ? multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol . a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out . those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs . the bottom line is that as a former agent , i lose sleep at night knowing what i know . pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda . that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent . the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits . read the book for enjoyment and homage . just do n't expect critical analysis . in fact , this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge ( for you ib agents in san diego ) .	0
i like the idea , but the slippers just are n't comfortable to stand on . it 's great while you are sitting , though	3
i am now going through what everyone else is talking about . finding replacement bulbs . for $20 this is unfortunately for some a " throw away " mirror . at least ours lasted more than 4 weeks	3

i could n't finish this book after readng " fairytale . " misfit insecure caucasian male falls for asian stripper / prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets . i thought possibly this story reveals a lot about olen butler . he wrote about this relationship with such relish , he sounds to me like a p.c. caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the " otherness " of asian people and does n't see them for what they are , just wants them to appreciate big strong white man . i thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother . so she was not honest with him . but olen butler wrote about her as if this stripper / pros . was wonderful , the kind of wife any man would want . i shook my head and thought , " you have issues . " probably if she were caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something . after this the other stories just did not appeal to me	0
i am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the milwaukee public schools system . we will use wheatley 's book as the primary resource for our professional growth at our mps middle school principals collaborative institute august 9-11 , 1999. we are not just concerned with reform ; we seek renewal as well . wheatley provides the basis . she notes that einstein said that a problem cannot be solved from the same consciousness that created it . the entire book is a marvelous exploration of this philosophy	0
if you 're looking to create the next doom 3 or half-life 2 , then i ca n't really recommend this program . if you want to make an advanced fps game , or a simple pong game , then i can recommend dark basic . in fact , dark basic professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with . the catch ? you have to program it yourself , all from scratch . dark basic makes manipulating 3d data extremely easy , but it 's not a game creation package which lets you click and create . if you are determined enough , it 's easy to learn all of dark basic 's commands , as half of programming a game is in the logic . dark basic will hardly limit you , and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in c++. the end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction , especially when you share it with friends and family . although previous versions of dark basic professional had some hardly crippling bugs , most of them have been eliminated , and with the release of upgrade 6.0 , dbpro is a very stable development engine . overall , i totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game , but is determined enough to learn how	5
every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight . we returned it to amazon , probably the first time we 've ever had to do that . for the price it should at least work . also , in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner . it earns two stars for looking great . i would not recommend it .	3
this was by far a great program , and never had a problem with it loading on our computer . fast installation and very easy to work with . plenty of available online , over the phone , or program tutorial help ! awesome program , even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers	5
i upgraded from version 5. i do n't use very many of the features . but the big difference i see is , files sizes seem to be greatly reduced . something i would scan and be 10mb , now might be 2mb . this is just opinion , nothing scientific . the interface takes some getting used to , a bit different . overall for the price ( $99 - less $20 rebate ) , a great deal	5
many repetitions are necessary in order to acquire a second language or a third , but the monotony of this program does not keep your interest for long , is so boring and offers not variety at all . this program will take away the excitement for learning another language even for the most motivated individuals , and will not help to acquire fluency because it does not equip you with the tools to construct language on your own . it does not contain essential grammar instruction , it is an error to suppose that the same grammatical rules of your language can be applied to other languages ( french is not a translation of english , or spanish , or any other language ) . grammar becomes essential especially when you are trying to construct correct structures on your own ; this program claims to help you learn " naturally " but leaves huge gaps by neglecting grammar , culture , conversational structures , and clear understanding , not natural ! for adults translation is necessary when trying to internalize the concepts , adults already have an understanding of language and are equipped to learn differently than children , sometimes even faster . i do not believe that " learning a second language like a child " is an accurate statement to describe this program , children are immersed in the culture , everything around them is the " real deal " , not repetitious pictures and recordings . children receive verbal and non-verbal input constantly , and adults have greater cognition than children do . looking at a picture while you listen a recoding might give you a vague idea of what it means , but there is not accuracy . it is very unlikely that you will internalize a concept that you do not fully understand . rosetta stone approach might be very effective when memorizing vocabulary and simple sentences , but i could achieve the same by purchasing flash cards for a fraction of the cost of this overrated , and overpriced program .	5
great book ....my partners therapist recommended it for him to read it helps you to understand & deal with the problems easy to read & understand	0

im a truck driver that dosent drink coffee . can you believe it ! ? my hours are really weird as my day may start at 8am or at 8pm & i might work for 10 to 14 hours per shift . ive used half a bottle to a full bottle at a time & have always gotten the boost i need to get where im going . i also may use it to start my day or to finish it . i started using 5 hour about 6 months ago . i dont use it everyday but when i need it , it works well . the nice thing is , when i finally call it a day i can lay down & get to sleep . unlike other products ive used , i dont have that ragged feeling afterward . i purchase in quantities of 100 & carry 25 or so on the road .	3
the mac os , $129 list , often cheaper , does n't get viruses , worms , malware , etc and probably runs all the software you do on a pc , with the exception of some games . go to a mac store and try it for yourself	5
this product is great for injury and leg elevation . my grandmother had a hematoma on her leg and she said that her " legs do n't fall asleep anymore and they feel so good . " my grandmother has had two strokes and this is just the relief that she needs . my mother has fibromayalgia and i 'm ordering two for her as well . she " test-drove " them before giving a set to my grandmother and this will be a great holiday gift for her	3
i had to return this product . i have a newer g5 imac with all os x updates and as a program it worked . but if you buying this for a sreensaver , like i did , the product did n't work . i tried emailing and posted a question on allume forum , got no response .	5
. . .uninspired and unsatisying . the writing style is austinesque , but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not . margaret 's motives and emotions are obscure , and the author 's assertion that her & quot ; heroine&quot ; has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed . quite the contrary . .	0
this cd was a big seller upon it 's release in 1992 , boasting a plethora of big hits , along with some new songs . looking back through 2005 eyelids , it 's hard to hear why these songs were so huge....the cd starts off well , with hits from the primitive love album , but as one keeps listening , he realizes that none of these songs have passion or depth , a few catchy melodies and pleasant , if plain vocals . the dance numbers at least keep you awake , but the years 1988-92 found estefan leaning on ballads , and one was barely distinguishable from another ; on top of that , the 4 new cuts feel like padding , to fill a cd 's worth of material for a christmastime release...a couple of hits are missing , too ( i.e. , bad boys ) , so to summarize , nothing truly bad here , but precious little on target.. .	4
it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele . the fusion is a classic example , from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel . do n't buy into the hype , the fusion is an expensive joke of a product .	3
for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions . using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times . this flash solves the problem . i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience . items were sent quickly	1
another great album by firehouse . my favorites are reach for the sky , when i look into your eyes , and hold your fire . i have other favorites , but there are my top 3. i have a story to go along with this album , ladies and gentlemen . see , i was heading to cross-country one day , for the huge " group 2 " meet . ( there 's a section , and 5 groups from every section make it , and there were four sections , so you can make the calculations ) . i listened to this album , having a bad day before , and having a bad night of rest . listening to this album , i got a river of positivity , and i had a great start and a great finish . i ended up smashing my last personal best in cross-country . basically ladies and gentlemen , this cd has alot of effect . get it . i love to review things . have a great day	4

i bought this straightener because i wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp . however , while it is not a horrible product , i have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better . i would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store . this is n't any better than those	3
with engines of creation , joe satriani did what he has always done : make the most of the tools he chooses to use . only this time , he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar . it would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote " satch boogie , " " war " and " flying in a blue dream " went . well , he 's still here , only more than ever he 's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey . i 've never heard robots having sex , but i 'm willing to be " borg sex " is n't far off . and although his calmly passing , sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure , that 's kinda how you 'd expect to see " clouds race across the sky . " the ' chorus ' to " devil 's slide " sounds as sinister as its name suggests and " attack " is as close to a musical sci-fi battle as i 've ever heard . to top it off , the album includes " until we say goodbye , " one of satch 's best ballads in his entire catalogue . if you 're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off surfing with the alien-style , you 'll find that there 's an incredible amount of depth - - and musicianship - - to be found . it 's not a satriani masterpiece , but its a true testament to the man 's enduring creativity	4
garbage metal - music for the american mainstream to feed on . i saw them open for slayer about 4-5 years back , and they had about 5 guys on stage doing nothing except jumping up and down . how pathetic ! pick up some real metal... . like old kreator .	4
i just purchased the hallmark card studio 2004 ( ... ) . everything installed fine but when attempting to print a card , the first side printed fine , but when printing the next side i keep getting the " this program has performed an illegal operation and will shut down " . i have been in contact with their technical support but have not had any luck so far . i have wasted a lot of paper and ink so far in getting just part of a card printed . i am running windows 98se . i will probably be returning this to the store ( if possible ) . it looked to have some nice cards on it , which is basically all i wanted it for , but for some reason will not print correctly on my computer .	5
this unit would be beautiful except for the fact that the input power plug and the on / off switch has a serious design flaw . i received the unit and it worked one time upon the first plug in of power . after that it became intermittent for about two or three switches off and on . it then failed completely and would not work at at all . i returned it and ordered another identical unit and it worked only one cycle on and would not come on at all after that . on both units the mp3 player continued to work . there is definately a serious problem with the power input receptical and / or the on / off switch . but for this problem it would be a wonderful unit	1
this version " wind and cloud - the storm riders " made in 2004 is not the same as " the storm riders " made in 1998. this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng . it is full-screen and was made for tv . it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours . most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen	2
sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie , but peter sellers did many better films than this . " dr. strangelove " was the masterpiece . " being there " is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington . " the world of henry orient " ( at last on dvd ! ) is priceless but virtually unknown , with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors . finally , the " pink panther " series is much better slapstick than " after the fox , " which has many famous , talented participants but is mostly silly , unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau & co. one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations , as if we might not notice them otherwise . i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted , and martin balsam does okay with his stuff , too . when watching this film , i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant - - i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money	2
spurlock decided to undertake an interesting experiment with his own health ; eat nothing but mcdonald 's fast food for 30 days . the result ; his health gets ruined . while spurlock 's experience is not exactly a scientific study you could publish in the lancet , it is a disturbing examination of what fast food and soft drink are doing to our health . i rarely eat mcdonalds ( though i enjoy the odd coke ) however the restaurant chain is quite popular in australia , as it is worldwide . the strength of mcdonalds and other fast food chains is obviously providing tasty food at low prices very quickly to the consumer . mcdonalds essentially applied the industrial technique of mass production to fast food , and made ray kroc ( its founder ) a fortune . i do n't really buy the line that multinational corporations are evil , because they are multinational corporations ; we have to remember corporations exist in relation to governments and ultimately consumers , as well as shareholders . we happily buy coke , mcdonalds , cigarettes , and many other things obviously bad for our health , and yet seem to like to blame the company which provides that addictive substance to us when our health goes bad . in our individualistic culture , we tend to all too readily avoid self-responsibility and the virtue of self-control , and in my view this is part of the reason fast food exists . however , the rocketing levels of obesity , especially amoung children , are of great concern , and it is clear the marketing techniques often aimed at children by fast food companies is at least unethical . we need to make sure the tide of obesity turns in the negative direction , otherwise this generation risks dying earlier than our parents and grandparents . spurlock 's experience is a warning to all of us to take the warnings on eating well and exercising seriously , and not ignoring them for the sake of self-indulgence	2
a great program . pretty easy to use . you have to play around with it to learn all the things it will do . i bought it usedfrom a list on amazon and it was fine . really like the program . linda j johnso	5
i saw this movie and i found it both shocking and choking . it displays children as young as 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! did the filmmakers take into account the damage tobacco could have done to these child stars ? ( yes , the cigarettes and the smoke were real , not cg . ) i think they should have omitted such scenes from the script , because it displays a behavior that 's not only illegal in several countries , but also threatening to both society and childhood . no matter what the other reviewers thought about the movie , i give it a disgusting 1 , and this is the last movie i ever watch that depicts smoking children . to those that have n't yet watched this movie , please do n't watch it , unless you want cancer to win the health wars . and here i hand out a lesson for every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want to depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead of the real thing	2
combine the high iso , low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects . this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class . the f31fd does n't have is ( image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor ) , which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking . but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom , for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact p&s you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results . is also ca n't prevent blur from moving subjects . with a high iso like on f31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too . fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on 2007 's compact cameras , the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras . ah , and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal.. . it 's really great , specially if someone who does n't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you , with f31fd they will not miss the shot	1
worthless . motor is loud and heating not noticable . in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm	3
i rarely write reviews , but quoting ebert ( who inexplicably liked this ! ) : i hated this movie . 1. is editor the correct term to apply to joe klotz ? i give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4. if you want to see a good slow paced movie watch l'aaventura . for a much better recent indie film about family life buy the squid and the wale . 2. if the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well . amy adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb , but sweet southerner ( see forrest gump , waterboy ) . i guess her performance reaffirmed what hollywood thinks of the south . notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from california or ny . does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs ? 3. i assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism . i feel bad for the masochists , but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit . 4. rent this first and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9	2
i was very disappointed in the content . there were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking . many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates . many of kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be " pre watercolor career " pencil sketches which i recognized . dark somber and sparse in my opinion	0
this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time . it 's " unauthorized " by muse , so therefore there were no interviews , no live footage , and none of their music was included . they interviewed people who had never even met the band . i learned nothing new from watching it . do n't waste your money	2
i 've always seen sheryl crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist . my wife and i got a couple of her disc 's , plus that " very best of " cd and was really looking forward to her latest , but this one...zzzzzzzz , makes me wonder what they 're putting in sheryl 's coffee . some reviewers are saying there 's " heart and soul " all over this album ? that may be , but it 's also very slick dullsville stuff too . as for the album cover graphics , i do n't see the roger dean yes covers or the 60 's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote , but a very " modern " graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using . kelly clarkson , the vines , the donnas , the list goes on . highlights : good is good ( i guess it 's time for a new " very best of " collection )	4
some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt . lots of cool instrumentation . pete anderson did a great job with the production . this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago	4
i hesitated for so long to get this . having followed moby 's rise since circa 1994 it has been amazing to watch what an impact he has had on music and on various cultural media over the years . i like his early techno / rave stuff and have enjoyed the gift he has for using electronica to score some beautiful and haunting hymns . but i wondered : has moby gone soft ? has he sold out ? i was pleasantly surprised . look at the cover and add rain . that 's the overall mood of this album . i find rain to be cleansing on many levels , often building a mood of pensiveness , reflection and a fragile peacefulness . there is a glorious melancholy in the music , the lyrics and the singing on the album . take the chilled out moments from moby 's other albums and build on it . that 's what he 's done here . almost every song has singing - primarily moby 's longing , almost cyring , voice - and almost every song is for those rainy nights , when the world does n't make sense , when longing for companionship and understanding burdens the heart , yet with a subtle hope underneath it all . it 's downtempo , mellow , moody and sometimes sad . but it is beautiful . do n't expect " old " moby , do n't look for the commercial jingles of play . just put it on and listen	4
while not on the ' highest end ' of tripod purchases , this one is a must for anyone owning a hdr-hc1 or other compatable camcorder . operating the camera from the tripod ( rather than the touch screen ) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer . the unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation . the only drawback is the soft storage bag which does n't provide adequate head protection	1

why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water ? ! how many calories does water have to begin with ? ! it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial ( ? a cheeseburger ? ) . please do not buy this . fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to... . no calories ! give the money that you would have spend to charity . the makers of this water are thieves and con artists	3
the worst book i 've read ( actually , i was listening to the audiobook ) . the characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that i found myself yelling at the tape player , " i know , i know already " . i could n't stand the torture anymore , i did n't even finish it . i have enjoyed some of ds 's earlier work , but will not buy another	0

( review written by my wife , the user . ) i 've happily used the quicken checkbook program for many years . when we changed operating systems from windows xp to windows vista , i was unable to get the quicken 2002 version to work in vista , so i purchased quicken basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program . the only feature i use is the checkbook program and as far as i 'm concerned , it 's perfect . i 've never used the download from bank option because i prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives . i use edit preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and i could n't be happier . the price is reasonable , too	5

having been a casual fan of stax records for a few years ; i decided earlier this year that i should go all out and splurge on this 9-cd box set . big mistake . i have many , many complaints about this set ; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess . it misses many key b-sides such as otis redding 's " hard to handle " and booker t & the mg 's " tic tac toe " ; and does n't even include every a-side the label released , despite the title of the compilation ( where are the sides that hoyt johnson released for the label ? ) . the linear notes by steve greenberg ( the man who gave us that phony " soul queen " joss stone ; and the headache-inducing baha men ) are horrible , mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and / or songs rather than the stories behind them . and within the sections for each disc in the booklet ; they entries are n't actually arranged in any particular order ( least of all the order of the tracks on the cds , that would make too much sense ) . and there should 've been more photos , too . add to this the set 's main problem : the music . the fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame . seriously . " why did you buy it , then ? " i hear you say . well ; the stax songs i was familiar with ( such as " green onions " ; " b-a-b-y " ; " you do n't miss your water " ; " ( sittin ' on ) the dock of the bay " ; " soul man " ; " born under a bad sign " etc ) are all great songs . " well , why do n't you like this set then " you 're thinking . answer : because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs . if you think i 'm being harsh on these songs , i 'm not ; i can appreciate songs like wendy rene 's " bar-b-q " and the memphis nomad 's " do n't pass your judgement " ; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers , most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad . basically , if you really like a stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist ; if your looking for a sampler of stax 's best songs , then go and buy the 4-cd stax story ; do n't bother with this one	4
the afro-eurasian eclipse is a groundbreaking suite , full of intriguing new sounds and grooves . ellington did n't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years ; instead , his compositions became more and more original and exciting . this suite has rocking , swinging , waltzing grooves that , though seemingly disparate , work together and illustrate the theme stated in the duke 's spoken introduction to the suite : to show that " the whole world is going oriental , and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity.. . not even the orientals . " duke does n't leave his standbys behind , though . the phenomenal playing of ashby , carney , jones , and the rest of the orchestra keeps the afro-eurasian eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity , even when playing to new grooves , melded with african , asian , and australian rhythm and sound . on a personal note , this is one of my favorite cds . aside from the remarkable music , it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction , at the beginning of the " chinoiserie " track . audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the cd , especially one with a single focus , like this one .	4
the cd is truly the very best of bobby vee 's works . a delightful cd . even my college age children enjoy the music . really worth the money	4
conclusions : to start from the end i got the xacti ca6 , tested it and returned it . here are the pros and cons . pros - 1. very small , just put in your pocket and go 2. easy and simple controls 3. super fast start up from sleep mode 4. good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode ( i had no issue with the video pausing , no way around that ) 6. you get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7. sd card that records for a long time 8. easy transfer to computer for editing cons - 1. indoor video unacceptable , although the video is brighter the ones my sony digicam takes , it is extremely grainy ( more so than my sony digicam videos ! ! ) 2. super slow zoom when in video mode 3. in good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry ( especially when trying to capture a kid on the move , for scenery it might be ok ) 4. in low lighting stills are unusable ( even at short distance ) due to a very , very weak flash . 5. red eye almost every time the flash works 6. strap is a joke 7. no lens cover so in short , on paper this camera is great , i love having the sd format rather than tape or dvd , the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless . but....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting ( see above ) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions ( for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical ) . this camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand ( for taking stills ) . for almost everyone else it is not adequate , i will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a minidv camcorder ( going for the elura 100 ) ..... ya , i know people told me that this was the best option beforehand , i was hoping to prove them wrong... . ; - (	1
i have had omord hr-100c for a few months now . i use it wile on my treadmill . it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate ; i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin . i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it ; i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem . the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand . the hr-100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor	3
this was my first year using turbotax , and it 's also my last ! since 1992 i was a faithful user of hr block 's taxcut for mac . in spite of it costing more than the windows version , i used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my aol dial-up service prevented me from using it . since turbotax is the only option out there for people who use a mac , you 'd think i 'd be continuing to use them for now on , - but you 'd be wrong ! i purchased my copy of turbotax deluxe from amazon.com to save $5. since taxcut made certain that no information from it 's software could ever be imported by other software , i filled in my personal data as i began . i was a little disappointed that turbotax does n't allow you to skip the " step-by-step " method , and just fill in the actual forms the way taxcut did as an option . while the downloads were an annoyance ( 6 or 7 separate files each time ) , for the most part the software was ok . picking up from where you leave off was n't always possible , but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot . my first major annoyance came with the state software . after filling in some data , and seeing the overall results , i wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data . i also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information i 'd entered . well , there 's no way to see your data on state forms until you 're finished and print them out ( or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue ) . when you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing , but the state forms do n't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool ! i found this extremely annoying , and a real time waster . the final blow , however , was when i got to filing . the advertising is an unnecessary annoyance . since i do n't owe any state taxes , i just usually print those forms out and mail them in - - - it does n't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when i do n't owe anything and i 'm not going to benefit from that " faster " refund . then i came to the crusher . turbotax wanted $30 for e-filing my federal forms ! ! taxcut charged $14.95 and $15.95 , but then they always rebated the cost . i was told that intuit used to do that , but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year . earlier in the day that i filed the saw the head of the irs on cnbc being interviewed . he said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler . well , if it helps them that much , they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the irs without intuit , h r block and the others as middlemen . and they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier . while i have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms , and then do your filing for you , i have n't heard of any security problems with them , so that 's the direction i 'm planning to take next year . as far as i 'm concerned , turbotax blew it by being unfair with their e-filing fees	5
i quote from glimpses of the devil , p . 215 : " ...after spending a half hour with that book , gods ' man . i called [a nun , six years my senior , who has been my spiritual director for more than twenty-five years] sobbing with a complex of emotions , including hatred for the author , disgust at the book , rage at its destructiveness , sorrow for all the other young boys and girls who had been the book 's victims , and a feeling of deep contamination that i had received just from looking at it . after we spoke , i sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years . " undoubtedly , dr. peck 's strong emotional reaction was due to the destruction the book wrought in the life of one of peck 's patients . but now you are forewarned	0
inspiring ? no ! pleasant ? no ! entertaining ? no ! worthwhile ? no ! what are you folks sniffing out there anyway ? whatever it is , please consider passing it along , because other than the single authentic and melodic track by patsy cline ( i.e. , back in baby 's arms , which is available on a zillion other collections including some of her own ) , this cd does n't have an ounce of redeeming musical , lyrical or social value in my view . nada ! zip ! even the dylan track is junk ! the entire cd is essentially drivel , put to the dull , homicide-provoking sound of endless , droning noise , with an overall signal-to-noise ratio of about one ( 1.0 ) ! ! ! what a waste of an a-to-d converter	4
paul johnson has written a 1 , 000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830 , years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today . johnson 's chosen foci are certainly broad : he ranges from events in politics and law to music , science , and even opium use . while almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function , johnson 's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting : he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning . also , while the book claims to be about " world society , " johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about british society - - but he 's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the " western " united states ( like kentucky ) to china and singapore . throughout , his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read . overall , johnson has given us what might be the ultimate in bedtime reading : a vast book that one can pick up , open nearly at random , and learn something interesting about the past but which retains significance today	0
this is a saccharine and banal take on irish music , with all the emotional intesity of a hummel figuraine . upon first listen , i remarked to my wife that they sounded more like peter , paul , and mary than the dubliners . she correctly pointed out that peter , paul , and mary were actually much better than this pablum , and that the irish rovers more closely resemble the fictional main street singers from a mighty wind . truly , absolutely , unlistenably passionless , cloying and bland	4

let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie . 1. it is incredibly beautiful animation 2. the music is amazing 3. i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series the things i do n't like about the movie : 1. the characters are not developed at all 2. you get the feeling your only skimming the surface , like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process . ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 , well that is becuase of the story line and plot.the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation . the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end . i just kept thinking there has to be more . but there wasn't . the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents . this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff . but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first . i 'm not saying its a bad movie by any means , just a bit empty for me.just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series	2
i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie . the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face . one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel . it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves . the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction , apparently oprah 's as well	0

i am a chemistry major and so i really like this book , however when i initially started o-chem , i did get a little intimidated by perusing through this textbook . so i suggest , to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at hornback or mcmurry . the text isnt an " advanced " textbook perse ( after a good grounding in the basics for three days , i found this book quite user friendly ) , its organization is completely different to most other o-chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic . both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity . an examples is that when introducing orbitals , and orbital interaction ; greeves et al quickly go to homo and lumo based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding . wade and mcmurry leave this , one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later . a second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals , lone pairs and charge . these are the things used to identify em . as such , the book isnt fragmented . each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry . chapters are well referenced so if , say you are only interested in nmr then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding . most textbooks act like a stupid monologue , miss a passage and you 'd completely miss organic chem . the chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant , it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept ( i.e. jacobs ) . however , the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who havent had enough experience in general chemistry . principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge . organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors . for individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry ; i would suggest you look elsewhere . a substitute ( a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry ) is hornback 's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry .	0
i bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , that to shoot macro-only with this lens is a crime . it is a very versitile lens . its fast f / 2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light . i pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens for family portraits , the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject . as others have stated , this is a heavy lens . it does n't have image stabilization ( is ) so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images . i use a beefy monopod for my best shots , although i have a lot of handheld gems.. . if you are tight for cash , this is n't the " one lens " that does it all . if you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits , this is that lens .	1
i 've tried to be a loyal quickbooks pro user for 5 years now and at first this company provided a competent accounting product that was decent after you learned its idiosyncracies . but each year you will be forced to update ( $$$ ) or your tax tables will not be accurate , and each year some of the capabilities will be lost and you will have to pay for them to be restored ( $$$ ) , each year the program will be more expensive to update ( $$$ ) . i am not an unreasonable business owner and i do n't mind paying for good service , but intuit has turned into a unethical , money grubbing monster . they sunset and disable your software every time you download an update , forcing updates and buying previously provided services ( payroll tax tables , e-mailing invoices , printing 1099 and w2 ) . this is especially true at year end , becuase they know they have you in a tax / year end crunch . now they are even doing unauthorised billing of new services ( last year they started charging quarterly fees for tax tables- -this year they charge a mandatoy $300 payroll update as well as a $100 software update for the program itself . ) furthermore they charge your credit card without permission under the ruberic that its the same as the quarterly tax table fee . honestly , consider some other program ! this deceptive practice of software disabling and data blocking , combined with the dubious practice of sunsetting software every year has grown intolerable . i hope they get the class action suit they deserve .	5
for any seasoned fans of the waifs ( or anyone out there with a predilection for folksy girl duets sporting brilliant guitar skills and voices to boot ) , ' shelter me ' will be no departure - -and no disapointment - - from what you 've heard before . the album weighs heavily on the waifs accoustical appeal . the majority of the songs carry themselves without backbeat or excessive instrumentation - - mostly it 's just the girls , their guitars , and the usual , typically wonderful songwriting that comes from josh cunningham , the third member of this stellar folk ensemble . the title track ' shelter me ' is a gorgeous , magnificently charged piece that will leave you reeling , " take me now where shelter be / before there 's nothing left of me . " vikki 's final track ' spotlight ' is a pure gem , emotional and raw but utterly beautiful . ' attention ' finishes the album well with that familliar waify energy and pulse , almost blue grass , almost country , but totally wonderful .	4
i 've been very critical of the fiction work of john grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting . well , he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting , if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of ronald williamson , a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row . i wo n't go into the details of williamson 's ordeal , but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book , that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers , but is still interesting nonetheless . he does a good job giving the details of ron 's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues . grisham did n't even think about writing ron 's story until after ron passed away , so there are no interviews to draw upon , but he does a decent job of tying it all together . i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty , he does n't hammer that opinion at you . he lets the story itself do the talking . i 'm actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham 's next novel , as he 'll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time . hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like " the firm " or " a time to kill " , not dreck like " the king of torts "	0
i usually use adaware to scan my computer weekly , and like others , i would like to try the trial version spyware doctor to scan my computer . the result was , i had more than 200 infections ! i was amazed that my other virus scan programs did n't catch any of these infections , and my computer had been running properly . of coz , i would like to remove these infections and so i paid with my creditcard and got the license no . after entering the license no . and scanning , i continued to remove the infections that spyware doctor had caught . before clickinig the remove button , i checked what i would delete and the files seems ok to be deleted . i had to restart my computer in order to complete removing the infections . i clicked yes to restart . from then , my nightmare began , i could n't start my computer at all ! ! ! not even displaying the loggin window ! my computer just kept restarting again and again . after 5 times restarting automatically , i smelled something burning from my computer ! ! ! i was so scared becoz there are some important files that i have n't backup yet ! endup , i reformat my computer ! ! ! i could n't login my old account again ! now , i have a new administrator account and lost all the softwares that i orginally have . luckily i was able to reinstall 70% of the softwares ( you gotta know the serial no . for most of the softwares are not working after reinstall , and that took me long time to find ways reinstalling them , and not all of them ! ) some of my important files could n't be opened again because i do n't have the softwares to open them ! i was / am still so mad about this ! the spyware doctor removed my system operating files and that 's why i could n't restart my computer . yet , i reinstalled spyware doctor again because i paid and only used it once . however , i could n't use it after reinstalling like other softwares . even i followed the instruction online to reenter the licence no . that i purchased , it 's just simply not working ( the website said i do n't have to repurchase and it should work ! ) so i paid $10 , only used the spyware doctor once , but i lost all other softwares that cost totally more than $400	5

looking at the liner photos makes clear that falkner is the prettiest thing this side of n sync ( and does n't he know it , especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of johnnie walker black by a leggy bunny flight attendant ) . which raises the question : is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound&quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that - - layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the stuff on the record , but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to , say , chrissie hynde and john hiatt cds . we 'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs	4
this album is absolutely fantastic ! paul and the band are incredibly tight and sound great together . paul sounds very loose and like he 's having a lot of fun - not as serious as some live shows i 've heard . the songs focus mostly on his solo records , with some jam and style council mixed in ( all on disc two ) . wisely , only five of the twenty three tracks are from " as is now " and they 're the uptempo ones - it 's not a hard sell by yep roc to make you buy that album if you do n't already have it . the extended jams for " porcelain gods / broken stones , " " in the crowd " and " foot of the mountain " ( one of my favorite solo tracks ) all are focused and do n't wander so they keep your attention . the crowd is energetic and into the show and are very appreciative when the jam and style council classics get into the mix ( although the sing-along to the album closing " town called malice " is pretty lame ) . i have n't listened to the somewhat difficult to find " live wood " concert disc for a while to give a good comparison . however , since " catch-flame " covers all his solo discs instead of only " paul weller " and " wild wood , " this is a more balanced collection . highly recommended ! personal highlights : blink and you 'll miss it up in suze 's room porcelain gods / i walk on gilded splinters in the crowd foot of the mountain that 's entertainment broken stones long hot summer shout to the to	4
this can be a very easy to use camera . simply by using the auto mode and composing your pictures properly you can get very good jpeg images . it also can be about as complicated as you want to make it . it has many advanced features on it . i have been shooting 35mm for about 32 years . my most recent before this one being an elan ii e about 7 years ago . it 's still working also . the 30d is my first digital and i absolutely love the camera . i generally work in the aperture priority mode with a tripod at 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , the camera is very capable in auto mode as well without the tripod . i like to shoot raw so that i can tweek things a bit , but the jpeg images are very acceptable . it also works extremely well for portraits . it actually is better than the 35mm to me because it has very low noise even at higher isos . 1600 looks about like 800 film to me . this is a very good value for the money in my opinion	1
i am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera . probably below average . i started trying to use 100% sony electronic products because my computer was a sony and sony-sony linkages make for easy use . given that , here is what i think of the product : 1. it is amazing how much camera you can get for the money . compared to just 6 months ago , or a year ago , this is a lot of camera for the money . it is very small , fits easily in your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it is very easy to use and recharge . 2. a visit to the sony website , suggests that sony has new cameras coming out constantly - - new cameras that are very similar . this makes it hard to compare cameras , even within the sony brand , and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it . 3. a problem with this camera , given it is so small - - do not shake . your pictures will be blurry . i am a typical guy , with very little fine motor control . my hands have trouble holding small objects . holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture - - well the results are not pleasant . 4. i tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras . i guess if you really want to zoom in , then you have to go to a big camera . but it still seems like the small cameras could offer more . 5. having said all of that , in the end , this camera is small and easy to carry , light weight , durable , and it is also easy to use . when you look at it , it looks well made . i ended up giving the camera to my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend to be technologically challenged . i said to them , just leave the dial set to the little green camera , and snap away . i have to say - they love this camera . overall . for the money , a great purchase , technology is amazing . just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than i have .	1
the only reason i 'm reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today . and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on . so.. . no , let 's be fair . i did enjoy analyze this , i really did , though it was n't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life , or even for the rest of the day . and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro ; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie . i did n't have very high expectations , though , because i rarely expect too much of sequels . once again , i was proven right . analyze that illustrates perfectly why ` sequel ' sounds like such a dirty word . the original film had a spark of originality ; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again . but of course , that could never work . it 's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel : those who have n't seen the original would n't understand the jokes , and those who have already heard them before . and that is why they fail time after time . so what does this movie have ? a great comedic duo , a couple of really funny guys . yeah , and ? fathers ' day had an even better pair , look what happened to that . a couple of good mafia jokes ? sure , sure . i even cracked a smile on several occasions . but that is n't enough . there are thousands of comedy films out there ; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable , and producers think they 'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas . newsflash : think again . nobody watches these movies . there 's no reason to when you can just watch the original again	2
the photoshare digital frame is a classic example of poor engineering . the " plug and play " ability is aggravating , at best , freezing two of my computers , requiring endless reboots to transfer images . photoshare provides zero customer support or technical assistance when you have problems interpreting the very poor operations manual . the expensive battery is almost impossible to install . the power cord has to be super glued to stay in place . and the frame is sloppy and dangerous - very easy for unit to fall out . buy another brand or just put pictures on disc and use a portable dvd player instead .	1
while one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool , the manufacture has indeed done so . the " spoon " portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil . i supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility , but instead of using a fastener or weld , its just rolled metal inserted into the coil . after only two uses the " spoon " came out of the coil and even though i could easily enough put it back together , after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay . basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now . would recommend buying a more simply designed , single piece shoe horn .	3
when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith , i ordered it the same day . after all , we seemed to be following the same path . i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several ` firsts ' in the area of gene cloning . then i found christ as a 40-year-old . my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian . hearing about dr. collins ' spiritual walk had me intrigued . his book should be entitled " a politician presents evidence for belief " . it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research . the human genome project is elevated to status of " bridge to a momentous new era " . hogwash . hype is the term i would use . the dept. of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources . the author could n't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more ` junk dna ' than previously thought . dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma . this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school . this is not entirely his fault , however , since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution is n't perfectly gradual and perfectly random . their motivation should be perfectly obvious , but it 's not even on dr. collins ' radar . he also uses mendel 's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics , assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel 's data was ` dry-labbed' . usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology . dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology : st. augustine and c.s. lewis . i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a " lyrical and allegorical flavor " . i would include the book of jonah in that category as well . however , there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked . the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything , it is to refute edward o wilson , richard dawkins , and their minions . even then , he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism . francis collins is the consummate politician- -he takes a stand without offending anyone . dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician , and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time . take this quote from mat 23:14 " woe unto you , scribes and pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation . " dr. collins ' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists . in my opinion it is a piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth .	0
i have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting . when up close , the image is excellent , but not so good for far away ( more than 100-200 ft ) . very easy to use , and the fact that it 's waterproof is a plus ( have n't dropped it in the ocean yet ! ) . you ca n't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area , but out on the beach , with the moonlight , it rocks . most of the time i do n't even need the ir illuminator . to save power , turn it off , and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes . if you 're looking to see things that are far away , this scope wo n't work well , but for things that are close by ( say , from one end of the backyard to the other ) it 's a good deal . i put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case , since it gets bounced around on the atv , and have n't had a problem yet	1
released is the kind of album you put in , kick your feet up with a good beverage , and head off to someplace on the silverscreen of your mind that is pure tranquility . oster 's trumpet echoes on long after the music is off . here 's hoping there 's more from this new and amazing artist	4

as a beef eating hindu i am very much interested in finding how cows became holy for hindus and beef a forbidden thing to eat . i browsed through this book in a book store and found it to be very disappointing . first , it appeared to be intended more for creating controversy than for informational purposes . it clearly had a bias which turned me off . second , i am generally up-to date on current issues and remembered that it did not generate all that controversy as mentioned on the cover of the book . there were some rumblings but nothing of the sort described on the covers ( " the government of india demands be ritually burned " ) . later i searched on google with the book title and words " ban " , " government of india " and found no news reports relating any government of india attempts at banning this book . there were no reports on ban by allahabad high court either . all i found were book reviews on the book and other articles written mainly by political commentators known for their leftist opinions . third , i found some material on internet on how the author misinterpreted much of the scriptures to support his conclusions . it basically left me disappointed and i am still searching for some reliable and accurate material on this matter .	0
old spice is a great-smelling cologne and i 've worn it for years . my dad wore it when i was growing up and i remember he almost always smelled of it . it 's a great cologne for lean , athletic guys who love retro ; it 's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men . it takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff . the smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention , otherwise he 'll just be annoying . old spice cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time ; exposing it to heat helps to age it ( leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building ) . trust me , it smells awesome if you let it age . i meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle . i 'm proud to say i 'm carrying on the tradition of wearing old spice cologne . it 's not nerdy and it 's not just for older men . it 's a cologne for any masculine guy . it smells great	3
i enjoyed francis veber 's ' the closet ' - released in france in 2001 - for two reasons . first , it features an all-star ensemble of french acting , certainly a tribute to veber 's skill as a director . just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits : daniel auteuil .... françois pignon gérard depardieu .... félix santini thierry lhermitte .... guillaume michèle laroque .... mlle bertrand michel aumont .... belone , the neighbour jean rochefort .... kopel , the director imagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth . each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back . the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber 's reputation . his previous release , 1998 's ' the dinner game , ' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece . actors get attracted to that type of skill . the second reason i got a kick out of watching ' the closet' : i just learned that ' bend it like beckham ' writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re-make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release , with chadha at the helm . her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham 's runaway success , so i feel like i 'm in on a really great secret knowing she 's working on a re-make .	2
i 'm not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the season 1 & 2 box sets , which is how you 're better off seeing them ( at least they 're in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes ) . instead i will be focusing on the bonus features . not the violent femmes music video , because that too can be found on the season 1 box set , but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features . i love the interviews and the " in studio " voice recording re-enactments , but i *hate* how every piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame . you can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen , and even then it is n't clear as there 's a bubble " shine " over it . i 'd love for paramount / nick to include all of the original , non-bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set , even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2	2
dracula . how dare you call yourself a horror fan without even seeing it ? you do n't have to like it , but damn it , you should at least see it . you can thank dracula for all the gothic imagery that 's been used time and time again in movies throughout the years , right up to this very day . you can also thank dracula for all the goth chicks running around , and that 's either a good or bad thing depending on your tastes . dracula 's not my favorite movie from universal 's golden era , but i 've seen it quite a few times in my life and will probably see it many more before i buy the farm . lugosi managed to create the dracula . they even discuss this in the documentary on the disc , but even folks who have never seen the film before instantly get the image of lugosi 's dracula in mind when someone brings the subject of dracula up . even with all the different actors who 've played the role over the years ( some turning in wonderful performances , some not so wonderful ) , they all seem to be in lugosi 's shadow somehow coz he just was dracula . lugosi gave a voice to dracula . ever do a dracula impersonation or hear someone else do one ? what voice did you ( or they ) use ? lugosi 's of course . however , i do n't think i 'd like this film half as much if it had n't had been for dwight frye as renfield . frye is rather unappreciated and never became well known outside the horror circle . he is to the character of renfield what lugosi is to dracula . sorry , tom waits just did n't cut the mustard for me . this film is many years old and probably would n't be considered frightening by a five year old kid . in fact , it most likely comes across as silly to younger folks with lugosi 's exaggerated stares , hand movements and dialogue . not to mention frye 's overacting as well . but the fact of the matter is , this movie scared the pants off people in it 's time . when was the last time modern audiences saw a film that truely frightened them ? who knows , and it 's not likely to happen again in our rather desensitized society . in fact , i doubt most modern moviegoers even have the attention span to sit through this 75 minute film . anyhow , you owe it to bela , dwight and yourself to check it out . as for the other films in the set , it 's kinda hit and miss , but none of them are bad by any means . apparently somewhere along the lines , dracula fathered two kids ( ! ) coz we have dracula 's daughter and son of dracula . neither movie is all that bad . dracula 's daughter actually tries to be a direct sequel to the original film with the daughter trying to rid herself of the vampire curse . dracula 's son on the other hand seems to enjoy the vampire lifestyle . chaney makes a decent enough vampire , but this son did n't inherit his father 's suaveness and charisma . the spanish version is a really cool gem that almost seems more atmospheric than the american version . house of dracula 's kind of the odd one out as it 's really a sequel to house of frankenstein , which itself is a sequel to frankenstein meets the wolf man . house of dracula is best viewed as a double feature with house of frankenstein . like the frankenstein and wolf man sets , this one has an interesting documentary tracing dracula from bram stoker 's novel right up to the frank langella film version . also sliming his way into this set is stephen sommers flapping his gums again about how dracula influenced his piece of crap van helsing movie . do n't ask me why i watched this feature , maybe i was looking for a reason to get pissed . anyhow , with a price tag like this and five universal classics , it certainly sold me .	2
the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good . i bought this primarily to see jaco . the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in . i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances . also , it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut . i still give it 5 stars regardless .	2

just received this massager and my wife and i ca n't stop massaging each other with it . especially great deal for the special amazon price . i 've been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones ( that just fit in the palm of your hand ) . glad i splurged . only problem is that amazon site says " 7 heads " , item description says " 6 heads " , and actul product only included 5 heads . the one missing , from the picture on the box , is the " acu point " heads . i 'm guessing that 's why it 's on sale ? still worth it if you get it on sale . great massager .	3
i looked at this camera the panasonic hvx200 , the sonys , the jvc 200 , and even canon 's bigger brother the x1. i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo.net , a great video forum . my concerns about 24f vs 24p were addressed to my satisfaction - there really is n't a difference . i like tape vs the hvx 's expensive storage solutions . one concern i had was , will it look like a pro camera ? that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent . as soon as i opened the box i was in love ! this is a really substantial camera . especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided , this does not look like your mama 's camcorder . i really like the manual controls , so that you do n't have to go thru menus to change parameters . the layout of everything is great . i really like the dual on / off and zoom controls - top of handle plus rear right side . holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very , very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned . only down side - and it is incidental . the matte box is a bit flimsy - lightweight plastic . that helps with weight , but i worry about breaking it . some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro , but my eye does not see it . the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low-light . if you are looking for point and shoot , this is not your baby , but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price - this is it	1
the trilogy just stunned me and i worked at trying to understand its complexities . then i read this book , and everything made sense . at first i declared that the trilogy was better than ' the lord of the rings ' but could not explain why . this book nails it . it will be wonderful if you read the trilogy , read this book , and share everything with your children . remember when ' expanding your consciousness ' was all the rage ? no ? that 's ok . all these books do it with a basis in science . buy the darn books . buy them for your friends	0

first i would like to state that sooner or later every computer user will come in contact with some problem with an internet security program . they are human made and not 100% fault proof . i study and work in the it field and was first introduced to pc-cillin through trend micro 's product housecall . soon after i tried out the trial and have finally bought the product . i love it ! i have used several of the other " major " anti-virus suites available and have had tons of problems with them . mcafee after one uninstall had bedded itself so far into the computer that i had to completely reformat the pc to gain functionality again . norton to say was n't much better . if you are installing on a " clean " pc where these other software suites have not been , i have not had a problem . i have installed / uninstalled pc-cillin many times each time running smoothly . the software has been a valuable asset protecting my pcs by alerting me to virus threats and even hacking threats that were not even on my network but on my isps network . as well as protecting my network from one single computer that received a virus by shutting off traffic to that pc . i can understand where some of the other problems reported with this software may occur if the person a beginning user or just unfamiliar with the framework of the software . but if you already have some experience in how to set this type of software up i really do recommend you give pc-cillin a try . it is a sleak program , easy to install , easy to customize , and really goes above and beyond with alerting you to possible risks and threats . with all its competitors out there i would choose pc-cillin over the rest any day of the week	5
cakewalk " s advertisement saying something like.. . " no experience needed to operate this software.. . " is , in my mind , mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most . i 've had it now for about three weeks , work on it most days , usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it , and still cant get anything out of it . all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work...blues , pop , country....so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up . i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen . beware...unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed .	5

im not sure where to begin with this review , its not that the book was poorly written , quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal . it was quite infact extremely boring , by page 300 i could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point i have loved the gunslinger series , they were all very good from front to back . there is way , way , to much about susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged , maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no wastelands or wizzard and glass . it was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement . it got to the point where i had to try very hard to pay attention and often i would find i had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again . im giving this book 2 out of 5 , very poor story line , poor plot however it was written well i can only hope that the next book is better , cmon king give me the feeling wastelands did , blown away ! ! rather than tired and exhausted	0
how did he have the time to write such a picture , to co-direct it , to act in it and after everything else to write its score ? noel coward 's energies , always remarkable , were redoubled during the second world war , and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism , which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing . in which we serve is still worth watching , but it 's nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed , and its focus on the " life and death of a ship " ( the hms torrin ) is strangely monomaniacal , almost constructivist . over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away , symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film . the ship goes up . the ship goes down . a new ship rises out of the water . and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat , till our interest settles on three- -bernard miles as hardy , with his striking , long , hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it- -he should have played ichabod crane- -john mills as blake , a tiny little pipsqueak who 's feisty in the standard mickey rooney-jimmy cagney manner , and noel coward himself as captain kinross , tranquil with class privilege and , in the background , his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson ( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums ) . hitchcok 's lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical , but without coward 's complicated flashback structure . coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively- -carey , in this movie and in brief encounter as well , treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth , nor good-looking in any way , who 's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest . she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it . who else would have written such roles for her ? the movie is trying indeed when it goes " serious , " and yet that 's half the fun of it , seeing how often coward plays the " race " card- - " we are an island race " indeed . i teared up , of course i did , during the blitz as the v-1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households , leading to the death of several favorite characters , and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half-nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool-aid . outside of these scenes , however , the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean 's tiresomeness , in showing everything at such a glacial pace . ps , the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose " masterpiece , " the poseidon adventure , sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve	2
my husband is away ( military ) and i was looking for the perfect , small but clear , pictures for him . i did n't care about the frame , only the small white digital system . i was hesitant , as my mil has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible . i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an sd card and transferring pictures from the computer . i love that i can use either batteries or the included plug . everything was soooo easy that i did not even need to read the instructions to begin . i also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later . this is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable . perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are ! then , when he comes home , it 's great for a portable album to carry anywhere	1

i have not try proactive . the thought of buying something from an infomercial just does n't sit well with me . i , however , have tried many many products since my 20s till now ( i 'm 35 ) . i spent thousands of dollars on expense department store 's brands like clarins , seshiedo , dior , clinics , chanel , and prescriptives . i 've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials , extractions , and chemical peels . i tried perscription cream , oitments , pads , you name it ( even thought of laser ) . i have mild acne problem year round , and it only gets worst during that time of the month ( that 's when i 'd run out and try new products ) . three days ago i bought the zeno . i 'm going to return it . it did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me . i also bought acnefree and today i went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag . three days now , i 've noticed my skin cleared up ! i 'm amazed . i 'm not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared . i 'll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve . so far acnefree works for me	3
i just got through reading " harvey penick 's little red book " . i enjoyed it so much that i had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller 's feedback page . but the book was that enjoyable ! i read the book because i was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals . i do n't even play golf ! i was able to apply harvey penick 's words to attitudes and approaches to life though ! he not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life , but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one 's life . his methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me . he refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings . instead , he accentuates the positive . he educates by guiding his students instead of " teaching " them . i love his ability to teach with images , parables and metaphors . his chapter " first things first " about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great ! after all , the problem is not always what you think . i challenge anyone to read " harvey penick 's little red book " and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives . whether you play golf or not , this book is good reading	0
this is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor . it is also a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order . kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part . the scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema . the cinematography and editing are a masterpiece . unforgettable	2
it 's not a great movie , but it 's a lot of fun . this is one of those movies that just catches me . it 's quirky and has some decent ( for it 's day ) effects . there are a feww laugh out loud momments . truth be told they are few and far between . some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble . the cast is pretty damn cool , with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman , angellica houston , john mat. . mattus.. . the big guy . anyway , it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot . hey what do you want ? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been . i still giggle at the time warp battle	2
somehow - this movie touched my heart and my mind - and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime . however - it just may be one of those once in a lifetime things - like first love - impossible to re-capture , and in a sense , haunting . i am not obsessive in any way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times - with each time revealing another layer of meaning - and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort . the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles - maybe their best ever - in combination with simply a great story most definitely puts this movie in a special category - so buy it and watch it . you 'll be glad you did . mik	2
if you want my review in a nutshell , here it is : two defective rise & shine lamps . one call to verilux . verilux refuses to help . if you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass , read on . my verilux product experience : i exchanged my first verilux rise and shine natural alarm clock & bedside lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker , ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping ( if i am to understand the verilux ' company president 's response to a similar defect report in these reviews ) . the good news : the speaker in the second unit now works . and contrary to some of the other reviewers i feel the mylar speaker sounds quite good - - although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice ( with a line-in jack for cd player or ipod ) . the bad : despite the jumbo lcd display that might lead you to assume that the am / fm tuner is digital , the radio is completely analog . the station ids are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead - - small enough that some owners will need their glasses and a magnifying glass to select a radio station . by contrast , i own an alarm clock by conair with a similar analog tuner , with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point lcd digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit lcd display . on verilux ' comparatively enormous lcd , i am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option . an analog tuner without a station display is something i expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock , but not from a product of this type , which is otherwise very well thought out . unfortunately , due to an apparent flaw in the shade and / or the lamp itself , the shade on my replacement lamp - - the lamp i received from the store in exchange - - wo n't sit straight ! one can remove the shade , look at the lamp on a level surface , and see the lamp " shelf " slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted ! making the situation worse , the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered . there are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down ( as typical of most lampshades ) . the ring , in turn , sits on the lamp body ( or shelf ) . the whole assembly is cockeyed , including the socket into which the bulb sets ( at a very obvious angle ) ! cosmetically speaking , there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type . whereas the first lamp i purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the lcd panel , the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf , and it , too , must have been obtained in manufacturing . as for the shade itself , it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish , roughly 3 / 4 " , that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen . so while the second lamp did not have a doa speaker , i apparently traded one problem in for another . worse , the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room ( and would probably appear that way from down the street if i were to set it on the curb ) . in short , the verilux rise & shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price / warranty suggests . and in case you are wondering if this might have been " gray market " merchandise , it wasn't . i purchased my rise & shine lamp straight out of a high-end , authorized retail store , new-in-box . the am / fm clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light , finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds - - contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5 " wide at the base and 20 " tall - - makes for an outstanding combination and concept . for this reason , i hope verilux will continue to refine the rise and shine model , particularly where quality control is concerned . given that i am a gadget fan , and someone who has rated products 1 / 5th the price of this lamp very highly , it should be understood that i really wanted to give this a positive review . but two duds in a row ? irony the rise & shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer . given that my replacement lamp is also defective , i followed these instructions . but in reality , verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers ' problem , not theirs ( as per the instruction i received to make a third 40-mile trip back to the store where i purchased it ) . conclusion ? verilux does n't back their warranty ( in my experience / opinion ) . nor , apparently , does verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers . so if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong , consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience . and believe me , there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of verilux ' customer service department , either . what verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the internet . as it so happens , i supplement my income writing product reviews for websites . in fact , i am a writer by training / trade . translation : verilux chose the wrong customer to let down . i have no intention of smearing verilux ' reputation - - unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such . would i recommend this product to a friend ? yesterday i might have said yes , chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke . today , coupled with the fact that verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy , my answer is a resounding no . should anyone at verilux read my review , i wish to close with this thought : i could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems i noted , but a ~$5 lampshade , to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box - - and does n't sit straight , to boot - - is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy ?	3
the story of " alice in wonderland " was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson , aka lewis carroll , wrote it . some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy . others consider alice 's journey as a trip into or through insanity . for better or worse , disney did capture many of these elements , and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film . however , there are also those who loved the books and loved the film . normally i recommend disney classis without reservations . in the case of this movie , i will keep a couple of provisos . alice is a young girl bored by her lessons . as the length of the lessons grows , alice soon drifts off , until a white rabbit passes by , muttering to himself that he is late . alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever . luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent . once at the bottom of the hole , alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small . however , there is a vial labeled " drink me " that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door . alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation . indeed , alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film . even the fundamental basis of alice 's journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies . the ending of alice 's journey in particular is quite frightening , especially to younger children , embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares . i remember seeing " alice in wonderland " as a child , and i remember i thought the ending was scary , and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world . given that this film is well over fifty years old , i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar , if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does . the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough . perhaps there is an object lesson for children here . while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs , i think that is a modern interpretation . i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use . remember that this story was first published in 1869. i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post-era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney . for all these provisos , this film is excellent . it matches " fantasia " in its surreal visions , and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb . the animation is marvelous as well , readily illustrating the vision of alice 's journey . this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers . whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste . if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults , then you may find this animation a treat . if you are open-minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated , you may also find that you enjoy it . i do recommend this movie for slightly older children , perhaps 8 and above , considering some of the disturbing images . good luck !	2

this book is a small bundle of common knowledge wrapped up in an insulting amount of hyperbole and hucksterism ( and very bad english ) . just how many times can you claim a technique will improve your workouts " by a factor of ten " or is the most valuable breakthrough " in history " before you lose all credibility ? in the first 30 pages , winnowing out the fluff , i read this : 1 ) fad diets , bulimia , and steroids are bad for you . 2 ) gaining muscle and losing fat are biologically distinct processes , so they require two classes of exercises . 3 ) it 's good to concentrate your attention on the particular muscles you are using during weight-training routine . 4 ) creative visualization and self-hypnosis can help you reach your goals . ( ok , i 'm a bit skeptical about this one . ) in other words , this book has taught me nothing of value that i did n't already know . looking ahead in the index , i can see much more of the same . i 'm afraid i 've been had . i bought this book on the strength of amazon reader recommendations . please do n't make the same mistake . look , to gain muscle , lift weights every other day and eat lots of protein ; to lose fat , do cardio on off days and watch your total calories . if you 're already doing those things , do n't bother with this book . i was looking for more specific tips , but i did n't find them here , and neither will you	0
i purchased the caruso for my wife after returning a conair infinity . the conair infinity did not measure up to her expectations . she is happy with the caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl . i will offer a few observations of my own . i would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer . for instance , women have different lengths of hair . this device provides 6 petite , 6 small , 6 medium , 6 large , 6 jumbo . that might be fine for women with shoulder length hair , but not for everyone . there 's not enough of one size to get the job done . there 's not enough of two sizes to get the job done . if your hair has just been cut , it 's to short to use the larger sizes , unless you have long hair to start with . my wife 's hair is not quite shoulder length , she 's got a problem . so , i figured , no big deal , just order a dozen of the right size . one dozen additional rollers cost $35. i only paid $29 for the unit with 30 rollers . that 's not what i call customer friendly .	3
one good song , of course " the sound of silence " , and the studio version is far better than this one . i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect	4
has all of the features that i wanted ; digital readout , body fat monitor . relatively easy to set up	3
feeding the cat...those girls shold put on a sweater . love this movie , 50 's detective noir set in 70 's california . the beach , the hospital , mexico , the supermarket , it 's all great - and the theme song keeps going throughout over and over . final scene pays homage to the third man , beautiful . a bit of violence , but " that 's how i treat someone i love , and i do n't even like you " . never seen an elliot gould movie i like more than this , & it 's my favorite altman as well	2
this is a great programme with windows xp but be aware that it conflicts with vista , the latest version of windows . an upgrade is recommended by nuance , the manufacturer to omnipage at double the cost of textbridge	5
this product is good for its price . the mini tripod inside the switchgrip looks very good and holds my canon pro perfectly . the travel bag is also very useful	1
this movie is a scream ! i laughed until i thought i was going to die . comedy does n't get any better than this . the characters are incredible . it 's amazing the actors could keep straight faces while making this movie ! do yourself a favor and watch this movie ! it 's even better the second time around	2
i 've tried a lot of different " nutrition " and " energy " bars , and these are my favorites ( along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry ) . great taste , a nice texture ( sort of like nestle crunch ) , and much more satisfying than candy bars . almost as tasty as girl scout " thin mints " , but not as fat - and guilt-inducing	3
annie sprinkles very personal heart felt spectacular sex guide inspires us into our sexual potential giving us the tools for sexual transformation . even if we already have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises here to try . i can relate to annie 's libraries of sexual experience even though i have not taken as many adventures as her . really folks if some of us turned off our tvs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom . my favorite quote would be " do n't worry ; be horny . " now that this wonderful book has been put on sale there could n't be a better time to buy it	0
thankfully i checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it . i felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it . i made it through the cd once with my kids , but that was it . we will not be listening again . as others have said , go buy the radio disney cds ( or possibly later version of kidzbop if they come with better reviews ) . the singers ( kids and adults ! ) on kidzbob are out of tune and just painful to listen to .	4
so i saw that this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it......when i got it , its like " um.. . is that it ? ? ? " it 's really cute , and really well made , but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards.. . also , there is no hp embroidered in the front like the picture has it , also , the strap that i got is really cracked and does not look good at all.. . other than that , it 's cute , but not the best out there .	1
alien invasion stories have been done to death since h.g. wells gave us the war of the worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre . well , william c . dietz pulls it off with death day and the concluding volume earth rise . what sets death day apart from most of the invasion tradition is , first of all , the invading force being made up of different races . this makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles , in-fighting and fight for freedom ( some are slaves to others ) make for something new , different and engaging . also , using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true , and tragic , note . the surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves , close off their borders and horde resources . the aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on earth . and , sadly , collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans . but the seeds of rebellion have been planted . humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races . all this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach . i enjoyed this book and recommend it highly . dietz is the best sf writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting .	0
i used aveeno moisturizer and thought i would try something new . i have eczema on my face ( around my eyes , nose and mouth ) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days . my skin is very sensitive , and have experienced burning with other products , but not this one . i sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy , yet strong enough to tackle dry skin . i highly recommend it	3
when i sow this in amazon and read the spec . and everything on it i knew this is exactly what i 'm looking for . it 's portable , handy , and it 's easy to use . the video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too . you can even download mp3 music and use it to make music video , or any music of your own . here 's what you do , output the audio to a power amp / speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video . shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the mtv music video	1
this is a godawful movie , a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible . they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the " sexy " health club craze of the 80s . actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make . lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so .	2
i do n't even own this cd , and after seeing the reviews i do n't want it . 90% of the " 5 star " reviews are people with only one review . suspicious ? ? look for yourself , it 's right there to see . i have some other meditation cds that are very repetitive , i 'm not going to make the same mistake here , especially with such shameless self-promotion	4
when i click the " update components " , i 'm continually told that " the feature is still initializing , please try again later " . this will happen even if i 've had the program open for hours . i 've contacted trend micro , followed their instructions for a workaround , but that still did n't help	5
made another bull**** album . honestly i did n't hear this whole album . about 5 years ago i was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd . oh my god for the first time in my life i wished i was deaf . i see the reason why her albums sell though . cause its her looks and nothin else . she 's not ugly at all to me . she just ca n't sing . but she can livin up a crowd . i 'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together , two of the worst people in music , millionaires . go figure	4
i got this game because i thought it would be fun . i was totally wrong ! every customer that i got brought only rabbits . rabbits , rabbits , rabbits ! ! ! this game confused me a lot . also , it gets very boring . and , it 's very hard to control . do n't waste your money on this game ! it will be a total waste of your money . believe me	5
really great ! beautiful graphics , easy to follow instructions , levels to keep us going . very fun and challenging	5
this is a very interesting book , particularly on the early restrictionists . it gave me a new perspective on why americans restricted immigration in the early 20th century , and gave me historical insight into today 's immigration policy crisis	0
i am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.it was kind of cornie but with yvonne ( lily munster ) decarlo and a great actor in rod steiger it held my interest , also throw in michael j pollard who always plays an off the wall character and i guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	2
ohm.. . ohm.. . ohm.. . back in 2000 , ellipsis arts released ohm : the early gurus of electronic music , a fantastic and essential three cd set tracing the evolution of " electronica " from messiaen , cage , and xenakis to schulze , eno , and hassell . this set was recently reissued ( as ohm+ ) along with a bonus dvd , which is thankfully now available separately for those of us who already have the cds . the ohm+ dvd is jam-packed with over two hours of archival and more recent footage that runs the gamut from engrossing to mildly interesting to unwatchably dull . if seemingly endless " talking head " interviews with milton babbitt and bebe barron are your idea of video entertainment , you 've come to the right place . an interview with john cage digitally altered beyond all recognition ? check . swirling psychadelic colored dyes right out of a saucerful of secrets-era pink floyd concert ? no problem . there are some tastier goodies to be found on this dvd , however.. . the segments with clara rockmore and leon theremin have an appealingly amateurish home movie quality to them . it 's also a real treat to see the 1978 footage of underappreciated minimalist guru david borden and mother mallard 's portable masterpiece company " on the road " hauling around their truckload of big old analog synthesizer equipment . laurie spiegel is fun to watch as she tinkers with a big grey metal box called a " concerto generator " with an extremely serious expression on her face . and alvin lucier 's " music for solo performer , " where he hooks up wires to his head and produces sounds using his brainwaves and two tympani , simply must be seen to be believed . the pixar-ish computer animation accompanying paul lansky 's " the dust bunny " is sort of cute , but it goes on for about 10 minutes too long . surely most of the ohm target audience already has the dvd of steve reich 's three tales , but it 's nice that they included the best part - the ominous yet goofy " dolly " segment . many have also probably seen hans fjellestad 's documentary moog before , but the six minute excerpt provided here is really about all you need . it 's too bad there is n't a more interesting john cage segment , and regrettable that there are n't any stockhausen videos ( those would certainly be a riot ! ) overall , though , while the ohm+ dvd is not as consistently engaging as the cd set of the same name , it is a worthy companion to it . and if you do n't have either of them yet , the complete ohm+ 3-cd & dvd " special edition " box set is a no-brainer	2
i love other preston / childs books so i thought i would love this one . i didn't . it is completely predictable . i was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists , but there were none . and parts of it were ridiculous : the length of the entombment , the amount of the treasure , the manner of transport , etc. the only character i really liked was the monkey	0
as teachers , we all get frustrated with the limited technology in our schools . we have the equipment , but it is n't adequate for all of us to use . larry cuban explores this problem in great detail , offering an explanation as to why the billions of dollars spent across the nation on computers is n't improving academic performances . he also offers solutions as to what the nation needs to do to remedy this situation . a very thought provoking piece ! if only our politicians would read it	0
while this lens has an attractive price tag , this lens has serious trouble with sharpness . only at high shutter speeds ( 1 / 250 and above approx . ) or with a good flash and middle apertures ( f / 8 to f / 22 approx . ) does it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving to buy and l-series or the is usm version	1
i bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower / tub combo . he loves it . esp. the height adjustment feature	3
i saw the scene , where they have lissa chained to the pool table and gagged in the basement.i did n't understand most of the movie . i bet kim possible , ron stoppabl , and rufus can deal with them	2
tim mcgraw does it again . it is a great album with some really great songs . a must have	4
i bought vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what i discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet . half if not 80% of all routers are not vista-ready yet , so you ca n't get a network running for at least a few more months . any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they 're compatible. . ( ie , printers , scanners , burners , etc ) so you not only buy an operating system , you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it . majority of my programs did not work with vista , be it adobe software , maya , poser and god forbid any games you own like warcraft . for the expense and complete hassel , it 's not worth owning until eveything is " ready " ( which will probably be a year from now ) save your money . - i returned my copy	5
...but this album should never have been released as the " final " queen-album . a couple of these songs should instead have been added as bonus tracks to one of those many best of queen-releases . " a winters ' tale " for example . do i know much about the background for " made in heaven " , well perhaps not . but i know that this is known to be the last studio release . sadly it has the sound of elevator-music all over , not that the melodies are bad , it just sounds.. . almost cheap actually -and most importantly to my ears ( at least ) this does n't sound like my queen . one of the most important bands in the history of music saying good-bye with " made in heaven " ? was this really freddie mercurys ' wish ? it does n't make much sence after the fantastic " innuendo " released in short time before his tragic death containing the haunting ballad " these are the days of our lives " . the words and the music.. . wow ! and the music video to this song , have you seen it ? to me that was the real good-bye with freddie , and with queen . and it has the sound of how i will remember them . but is " made in heaven " really that bad ? yes , and no . " heaven for everyone " by roger taylor made it sound promising , and do n't forget ; i was exited when i heard about " a final material " -release . but it turned out , as you might have guessed , far from what i had expected . old songs from b-sides and solo-albums are mainly fillers for this album.. . i mean honestly ? " too much love.. . " then quite a resent hit from brian mays ' solo-album " back to the light " , i remember thinking " what 's the point ? " and it actually sounds better from his solo-album without the synth dominating the song here . do n't get me wrong now , freddies ' vocal is as good as you 'd expect , it 's what they 've made out it that surprises me . and what makes me wish they hadn't . at least not for an entire album . " a winters ' tale " is a positive surprise though . perhaps not freddies ' best song , and not better than " these are the days.. . " . but it 's a celebration of the beauty in life . at least it sounds like that to me . freddie captures a moment of harmony and peace . and beauty . and it sounds like a classic queen-song ! " a beautiful day ( intro and reprise ) " functions well too . but what tracks 12 and 13 are about i have absolutely no idea. . ? i wish they would have ended the album with freddies ' last " yeah ! " on the song . i wish.. . so all in all ; " innuendo " remains the explosive good-bye with the " real " queen . at least it does to me . ( let me add that the cover of " made in heaven " is perfect for the title , and somehow amazingly " seals " in its ' simplicity the fate of the band with freddie in the lead . the three band members left ( brian , roger , john ) facing the sunset , and a statue capturing freddie in a remembarable style on stage . reminding me of him at wembley 86. to me this actually expresses something beyond words , and it 's impossible not to get a bit of an empty feeling watching it while listening to " heaven for everyone " or " a winters ' tale " . )	4
i 've had this camera for three years . i bought it new , when it was cutting edge and very expensive . i put a 128mb cf card in it . first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software . i 've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it , it 's been all over the country . the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i have n't had any problems with it . the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder . if battery life were that big a deal , one could purchase a second battery and rotate . all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera . they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great . when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin . scratches , oil , freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping to fix the flaws . other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better . i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture . by the time the shot 's taken , something ( especially a squirmy child or a sports play ) has invariably moved and it 's not the exact picture you wanted . i 'm going to buy a real single-lens reflex ( slr ) to take baby pictures , but i 'll keep this as a travel camera	1
i can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book , but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training . here 's the problem . the book and cd basically outlines a method of ear training , it is not ear training itself . for example , for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the cd . it is just that , an example , not a training . so , there is one 14 note " lesson " on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals . i do n't think so . however , if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals . you could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that 's the core of ear training . in fact , if you 're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords . by the way , the cd itself mostly uses really dull organ patches . the idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction . however , since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone , this is another example of how this book / cd in itself wo n't be of much use to students .	0
the zr500 and other low-end canon camcorders appear to be very fine products , well worth their price - - but if what you want is the simplest and easiest way to make perfectly acceptable amateur-level home videos , have a look at the rca small wonder . simple , rugged , totally easy to learn and operate , no frills but still some very neat features , takes perfectly adequate videos of your children , your dog , whatever - - and about half the price . bought one ; totally satisfied	1
i bought it new . after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower , it stopped working . i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop . braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior , including the electronics . they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me . i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower . i have not opened the shaver , i have not cleaned it in water . thus , based on my experience , this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	3
as crow puts it , if it had not snowed on that monday in march . the snow led to a chain of circumstances with crow bringing a homeless teenager home for dinner and a place to stay for the night . it turns out that the teenager , lloyd , was a witness to a crime , and that draws tess into the case when she connects lloyd to a news reporter . events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source . the story starts with a narration by crow , and alternates between crow , tess , and other characters in the story . you will get a lot more crow in this novel than in others . the story has an interesting ending , and you can wonder if lloyd will show up again . you get some information along the way about baltimore soup kitchens and the homeless , and a view of the underside of society where life is sometimes cheap	0

it was amazing when i read this , how self centered and morally wrong this man was . it makes me sick to my stumach to read it . this was nothing more then glorifing his looting and murdering in cold blood . if you have a chance skip this one and read somthing like " company commander " or " band of brothers " somthing worth while	0
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying to decide which ultracompact was the best deal and the best overall camera . in the end , it came down to panasonic 's fx01 and cannon 's sd600. i read the warnings from other reviewers that the panasonic 's images were n't top quality , but i chose to ignore those reviewers because on paper the fx01 looks like it would out perform the sd600. i was wrong . after using the fx01 for a few days i knew what those other reviewers were talking about - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera to be great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then the 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera to amazon ( very easy-great service ) because of the poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs is why you take photos , right ? i know someone with the sd600 and he 's very happy with the quality . judging by the customer images on the sd600 's page on amazon , i think i should 've gone with cannon	1
it 's great . nice top storage for memory cards and extra battery . compact . perfect for camera size .	1
i received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it , i ran into an error message : " unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery . " i did what i was told . several times . same message . argh ! ( to my husband 's chagrin , i read the user 's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me ? ! ) i searched the web looking for a solution , but all i found were perhaps hundreds of people with the same message on similar jvc model camcorders , rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from jvc once their warranty ran out . luckily i ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product . sure , you might not believe me when i suggest to stay clear of this model . i 'm constantly disregarding amazon reviews that preach " do not buy this product ! " , etc. that 's why i 'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you 're still convinced you want it . suggested search on google : " jvc camcorder safeguard mode error " .	1
went to see this movie at the imax in san antonio this weekend . i have to say i actually laughed most of the way through . the effects were decent , but most of the time i had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3d effects . that was when i was n't having to " look around " the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie . some of the torture scenes and the faustian plotline , along with the hideous firey face that is mr. d make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10 , but the terrible plot along with the worst voice-acting i have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10. basically , i guess you could say i was slightly displeased with the movie . i do have to admit that i got a hearty laugh when the main character , johnny ( played by jasper steverlinck , an up-and-coming rocker and lead singer of the band arid , a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot i could find in the movie ) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil mr. d and destroy the haunted castle . unfortunately , the scene was designed to be serious	2

i bought this straightener at the advice of my hairdresser ( well , the pink one was my idea ) and this is by far the best product i 've ever used . i even took a long run yesterday and my hair still looks great - and it 's usually a nappy , tangled mess after i work out . there really is nothing better than the chi for straight , silky hair . i 've used it on a couple friends and they swore to go out and buy it . it 's worth the price	3
as others have noted , this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in spanish sung by maria del rey , plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men ( not very good for putting a baby to sleep ) , plus the whole thing repeated in english . in addition , i had been looking for traditional latin american pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary . do n't waste your money...i 'm planning on giving my copy away if i can figure out someone i know who could actually use it	4
the singing is terrible on " fly me to the moon " . do n't take my word for it . listen to the free sample supplied by amazon.com . at 16 seconds into it , when she sings " all i worship and adore " , she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes ! even someone with no musical training can hear it . the rest of the pieces sound fine	4
abby cooper has become my favorite amateur pi . the premise of this series , a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases , is original and fun to read . abby is a psychic , but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman , money , sibling and romance issues . in this latest book , abby , her sister cat , and abby 's handyman dave , buy and plan to renovate a house , only the house turns out to be haunted ! poor dave , abbey 's partner and handyman , is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation ! determined to find out what 's going on , abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to wwii nazi germany . in order to solve the mystery , abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case . there is danger for abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between abby and dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple . ms. laurie has a great series going here , and i look forward to reading more abby mysteries .	0
this seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer . basically it 's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash . it is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage . when used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed . the white box is for general use . also available are the green omni-bounce for florescent lighting and the gold omni-bounce for a warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution for better flash photography . a quality product that works . cons : non	1
ok ! being the richest human being on the planet called earth , bill gates decided that he 's not wealthy enough . so he released this microsoft office 2003 , which i really think is not much different from previous edition . the price is , as usual , very expensive . what 's worse is that bill gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version . so mere mortals like us need to spend extra big money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents . i can see bill gates , being a deified bloodsucker , using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper , and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live . so shame on you bill gates and microsoft	5
this dvd teaches the history of tai chi , and the history of the 24 posture form and 48 posture form . it explains that these two tai chi forms were originally a martial art style , and that now they are usually done for health improvement . then it shows the 24 posture form from the front , and the back , and with breathing instructions . im not quite ready to try to coordinate my breathing with the movements , but when i am , this is a great guide . it then shows each of the 24 postures , and their original martial art applications , which helps you have a strong intent during the posture , and keeps your arms and legs in proper position . then , it teaches the 24 posture form , step by step , with very detailed instruction . this is a much more expanded version of this video by master liang than the original vhs . the dvd also shows the 48 posture form , which repeats several of the movements from the 24 posture form , and has other movements from other styles . it has absolutely helped me develop strength and balance in a few short weeks of practicing only the 24 posture form about 4 days a week on average . it has also improved my confidence , and people keep saying i have a glow about me . i just feel healthier , and happier too . this dvd is easy to learn from quickly . the chinese bamboo flute music is nice . oh , actually , my favorite part is at the end , it shows a ' slideshow ' of photos of the master , doing each posture move-by-move , with great music . i like to do my form along to this section , because it is a bit slower than the actual form , and you can exactly match your movements to the master . its like having a one-on-one class with him . i find that this mimicing of his postures has helped me to learn more quickly . i remember the form now , without having to ' think ' , so i can try to turn my attention inward . a great dvd	2
another product of hollywood 's " karaoke culture " . in an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind , we have in " u-571 " an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of " das boot " . but instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war , we get a cheap flag-waving pile of hollywood propaganda . the lighting , camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by db . but the bigoted innacuracies ( german submariners machine gunning helpless sailors ) and absurd scenarios ( an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit ) put this ridiculous movie in its own category . u-571 is just another thin , over-promoted , throw-away movie you 'll forget the day after you see it	2
either you get on the train or you don't ... and as long as you continue to get on the train , you 'll grasp the meaning of christmas . the true meaning of christmas . but you have to be willing to get on . this movie was a great adaptation of the classic story . i must admit i was a tad bit wigged out by the animation . it was just oogey in some ways . realistic at times and , at other times , so unbelievably fake.. . i could n't decide if i liked the animation or not . still can't . but the story itself is worth the struggle i had with the animation . get on board ! you 'll be glad you did .	2
the bag is suppose to hold two cameras , i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries . i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here . might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl	1
they say 100% compatible but is not , because is not an info ion-litio , so is not a eqivalent battery , dos n't work . do n't expend your money on this stupid batter	1
the first one of these i received broke after 2 uses . target.com quickly sent a replacement at no charge , and now that one has broken after about 5 uses . very frustrating , because otherwise it seems like a good system	3
this was the first digital camera i purchased . i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle . this camera was n't it . the good *it is compact , which is pretty convenient *it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno-savvy . the bad *after snorkeling with it for 30 minutes , the camera leaked and broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay in costa rica was over . *the functions are unreliable and difficult to use . rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want . the pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . *the zoom sucks . do n't expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience . *the image stabilization is a joke . you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that are n't blurry . *the user manual left me with a lot of questions	1
i used this to get marks off my washer and dryer and then went on to clean the rest of the house ! this little " sponge " is awesome , and it is just like a sponge ; it 's not abrasive . the only problem i see with it ( and all cleaning products ) is that you actually have to use it for it to work ; lol	3
as owner of every single chill / lounge music cd i am aware of , this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time . ultra chill series 1-4 was outstanding . while ultra chill 05 is not a complete disaster , i could not find one song worthy of a 5 / 5 star rating . quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs . some of the better songs were repeated on older chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs . there is a lot of jazz and latin chill on these two discs , which i also like , but the jazz / world / latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great . i think the person that rated this 5 stars does n't own a lot of lounge / chill and is probably a lot easier to please . i 'm very dissapointed . maybe this ' genre ' is all dried up ! : ) oh well.. . i 'm off to listen to " chillout seesions 8 " ... hopefully it will be a lot better . i highly reccomend chillout seesions by ministry of sound . chillout sessions 1-7 are outstanding.. . time to go listen to the new 8 !	4
i like a little bit of it , doesent mean its good , i wont throw it away or anything , ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time . slayer is getting better though	4
this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy . a year after this book was published , there were over a hundred reviews . regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author , finds the author right or wrong , interesting or boring , this book is one of the most influential books , if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy . in fact , the current bush adminstration 's policies , george kenan 's containment , henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book . my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments , and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book . it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations , differing on extent . ( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after ) . it is a fascinating book and hard to put down . the author writes in a european style ( beautiful long sentences , etc. ) , which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read . he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically . ms. rice and mr. kissinger were heavily influenced by this book . to understand them , this is a must read . in and of itself , it is an excellent book , a classic , and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it . look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists	0
i 've had a ton of these , and i take them on camping trips with kids where the main activity is playing in big mud fields . i 've had them in my pocket while rolling around in the mud , taken it out , shot a few pics , put it back in the pocket with no problem . ( see pictures for examples of " mud photos " ) a couple of times i 've had them stand up to so much moisture and abuse that the cardboard falls off , but still had beautiful pictures every time , no jams or over-exposures . i 've found the two pack at walmart on sale for $8.99 a couple of times , and you absolutely cannot be that deal . this is my favorite disposable camera , and i 've tried them all .	1

well , here we are . one of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90 's , " lifeforms " is true sonic adventure . this is obviously some of the best work that fsol ever did . " lifeforms " is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together , interchanged and meshed . for ambient work , it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace . there is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs , despite their being ambient . it is very original , i praise originality in music . give it a try , put on some " flower " " bird wings " or some " elaborate burn .	4
these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage ! pure nonsense ! trust me , i know this because i used to buy them . i first bought these pills last year in june 2005 after hair formula 37 's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage . well , these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned , and had promised also to change dry and brittle hair to long and healthy , and it did absolute nothing . i said to myself , like hair formula 37 , that maybe i just need to give this more time , so i bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all . this product might just work for others , which it has , but it certainly did n't work for me . i must admit that i brought this on myself , as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway , and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store ! these hair growth pills are too damn expensive , so when you are paying all of that money then you expect it to work . the fact that it does not is infuriating because $39.99 + $7 in shipping , with a total of a little over $46 , is a lot of money to spend on something that does nothing . thus , i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money . and if you are going to , please do n't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com .	3
this is panasonic 's entry-level camcorder , but it 's packed with useful features , like good image quality , 12 lux sensitivity , and a whopping 30x optical zoom . i think it 's perfect for casual travel videography as well as for shooting entries to the " america 's funniest video " show . it 's fairly easy to use and the build quality is solid . a good optional accessory to get is a spare battery . you never know if the battery might run out at the most inopportune time , so be sure to pick up a backup one . given the recent dell recall of 4.1 million laptops due to battery fire , you should get a genuine panasonic liion battery designd specifically for this model . do n't put your life or your loved one 's at risk . the reviewer named " hung " got it totally wrong ( or was just plain lying ) . the gs29 does come with ieee1394 firewire ( aka i.link ) so you can download your videos quickly to your pc ; if your pc does n't already have an ieee1394 port , you can get a pci ieee1394 card for $30 or less . you can use windows movie maker , included with windows me and xp , to edit your videos and export them to cds or dvds .	1
this book captures the human spirit , at both its best and its worst . schwarz-bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of ernie levy , from birth and on . he also , shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the nazi movement . it is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the jewish people . it is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a just man , although without them humanity would crumble , as future readers will find out their importance . and if there really are just men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders	0
well you know the rest . aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired . these meals cannot be done in 30 minutes , unless that is if you want everything half cooked . the book makes false promises and does not deliver . there are also no pictures and no index and the recipes are very confusing..most of them deriving from an original master recipe and then just changing one or two things . if you want good food and a good cook book do n't buy into the hype and do n't buy this book .	0
i expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read . what i did n't expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers . from the opening pages of the book , as wylie jones prepares to depart on a & quot ; business trip&quot ; of unspecified duration , to the penultimate chapter , when a revitalized wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the left coast , this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice , hints , tips , and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways ! think of it as a kind of business allegory . wylie 's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if robert fulghum were to meet john gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike , set fire to robertson davies ' beard , and then move on over to the highway hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than warren buffet , everyone 's favorite grassroots investor . i totally loved it . it gets my absolute highest rating	0
movie boring.. . story drags.. . barely any action.. . if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing.. . booo	2
i hate to trash on an american classic.. . but this was truly horrible . i thought my son would like this due to the flying car . it took hours of torture to get to that scene . horrible , horrible film . mindless , drawn-out banter , and weak story line . our copy eventually broke ( stepped on ? ) - - - we felt sooo lucky to have it gone . " one star " seems like a generous rating	2
this is a well-written , thoughtful film . charlie hunnam ( pete ) really stands out to me - he 's perfectly cast , compelling to watch , and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his " mates . " it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood 's character evolve . the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well . the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must-see	2
does anyone know whether this set will become available on sacd or dvd audio format ? how would you contact grp records to ask ? i only give it four stars until multichannel format appears .	4
ok , you guys . as i have stated , this book let me down ! it practically ends on page 195 , and there 's still 65 pages to go ! my advice-do n't even start it . also , i tried the killer 's cousin . i was n't pleased with that , either . so , my conclusion : if you 're looking for a good read , do n't expect nanxy werlin to fulfill your needs . if you need good , suspenseful stories , try lois duncan or caroline b . cooney ! one great , outstanding , wonderful book : swimmer-graham masterton	0

i am a motown , oldies , r&amp ; b , soul , love songs , music lover.i like the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come alive to the rhythem and bill withers definately fits right in there . i do n't realy have a favorite artist because i like sooooo many of them but if i had to pick my top 10 , this album would be in there	4
this cd was well worth the wait ! it contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years . i took one of the cds out of the box , put it in the player , and within minutes my wife and i were dancing . the sound quality , in my judgment is solid , the packaging is fun and creative , and the booklet containing the cameo parkway " story " was an interesting read . there will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included , but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era . what great fun to hear the orlons , chubby checker , the tymes , the dovells , bobby rydell , and dee dee sharp once again .	4
i really feel stupid about ordering this book . why did i do it ? . the story is that stacey is moving back to new york	0
i bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in cnet . however , i just bought a new dell inspiron e1505 that shipped with windows vista home premium , and zonealarm 6.5 is flat out incompatible with the new os . i downloaded zonealarm 7.0 and that is flat out incompatible as well . i 'm sure this is a great security suite for windows xp , but beware if you have vista . there seems to be no update on their website when zonelabs will release a vista compatible zonealarm . ( they mention something about " after january 2007 " , but it 's march , for crying out loud ! ) so there 's my purchase price of a good product down the drain	5
this is an extremely flawed software program . i have used quicken for more than a decade , and this product is not worthy of the name . runtime errors keep me from evening getting the program going . it contains 6 bank accounts which i cannot currently print checks from . i have reinstalled the software at least 15 times with no success . i have used every suggestion from tech support and the quicken forums without any success . i guess i 'll have to move to ms money	5
i purchased this camera after reading reviews and tech specs about the camera . it 's either not enough , or it 's too much ... i 'm not sure which . i returned it and purchased a 10 megapixel powershot a640 which has a swiveling view finder ( which is great ! ) and will suit my needs just fine for about $200 less .	1
a great read for anyone interested in cards . i managed to pretend to my friends that i knew nothing about cards before cleaning them out after reading this book. .	0
i am not a spring chicken , so i get introduced to anime through my daughter . some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day . full metal is none of these . the characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor . ed and al are young boys . their mother dies . they desparately want her back . they do something forbidden . they pay . and they learn what the costs are . the world is a confusing place . they navigate , sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way . not everyone is who they seem at the start . finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules . through the story there is humor and growth . the story is told from their point of view . they do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other . i highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies ( that 's me ) . much better than most things available for teens these days . i rank this up with dante and faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives .	2
adobe photoshop has a long history of being the best software in the business . it 's only downside is that it may seem a bit daunting to the beginning user . there is , however , a plethora of texts , tutorials , learning guides , and even video 's to help abate the learning curve	5
i purchased this for my wife for valentine 's day . the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device . first , the software to do the picture transfers is awful . you can only select pictures on your computer to download - you ca n't see what photos are on the device in the software . in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself . i checked the webpage for updated software - no joy . the crop feature is nice ( and well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows 3.1 application . second , the image quality on the device is very poor . i did n't have very high expectations , but this was lower than i expected . reminds me of the picture / screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens , maybe a bit worse . you can make out the picture , but not much detail at all . the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea , it 's the only way to get a decent picture . overall , i 'm a little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay for. .	1

upgraded from an old norelco to this and just love it . shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip . the only con i see is the 8 hour charge time , which has been the norm for norelcos in this class for a long time . if you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price , this is a great choice	3
i wish that i could review how well this charger works , but unfortunately i can't . the reason is because it was dead on arrival . i essentially bought a $20.00 ( with eek technology 's outrageous shipping ) brick . it never worked , ever , and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit ! at least i have the 4 batteries it came with , so it is n't a total loss . do n't make the same mistake . steer clear of this piece of junk	1
having just read the book ( most highly recommended ) i decided to treat myself to the movie . i could have cried . while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book , i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around . in the book , the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character . in the movie , they got rid of one man , had the other eaten right off the bat , pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy . in the book , nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters , and he does not have an elaborate home on the island . and what about those stupid giant animals ? i do n't recall reading about them . the fence around nemo 's home looks like it came right from jurassic park . the whole story was about 5 ( eventually 6 ) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there . on another note , the graphics were pretty bad . the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy . as one reviewer well said , it is suitable for children who are easily pleased , but it is nothing like the book . perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only $6.99	2
set the diffusion to ' stun ' when you do n't want your flash to ' kill ' with harsh , sharp , shadowy edges . yes , you need this if you have an sb-600. why ? nikon does n't make a diffuser for that model . basically , it fits snugly on the tip of the flash , slides off and on easy , will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks , like that macro shot of the benihana chefs . here 's what it does : diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments . simple , sherlock . the omni-bounce ( what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic ) performs as expected , no real cons , except shipping adds almost 50% to the price , so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering	1
practical , sage advice from stanley . not as good as his follow up , " the millionaire mind " this book is somewhat pedantic . it also suffers from the fact it 's extremely dry . the author 's writing is much more engaging in his followup , and that 's a much faster read . in addition to offering some practical tips " the millionaire next door " also lends itself to parody in books like dave barry 's money secrets , a book called " maybe life 's just not that into you " and something from andy borowitz , the name of which escapes me . if you have to choose between " the millionaire next door " and " the millionaire mind " go with the latter .	0
ok ( i imagine there 's still drool over my & quot ; earlier&quot ; review...and my wife is none too pleased either.. . ) truth or dare time ! i bought this cd out of none-too-scientifical curiousity , that , and & quot ; let me blow ya mind&quot ; - and guess what ? i 'm beginnin ' to dig the entire cd . as i mentioned , 99 & amp ; 44 / 100th% of & quot ; rap music&quot ; fully explains to me what gregg allman meant when he sang , & quot ; it 's not my cross to bear . &quot ; ok , that being said , eve pulls no punches ( although the & quot ; skits&quot ; on the thing about wet myself laughing ) , and she 's not a lady whom 'd i 'd like to cross . but & quot ; i bought the ticket , so i 'm gonna take th ' ride . &quot ; and enjoy myself mightily while doing so. .	4
before that it was kind of nice , but it cannot focus in even semi-low light . it is definitely light and easy to take everywhere , but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing . no way i would call the output hd quality , just the best sd ever with a 16 * 9 format . and then it broke	1
this is a cute tale of of young girl fantasizing about an adventurous and unfettered life , not a bitter anti marriage tirade . her suiters are symbols of adult responsibility , which she will ultimately grow into . in the meantime , she is having a good time . the story is funny , the illustrations lively and colorful	0
i would often rush to see all arnold schwarzenegger films , i adore his bad acting " it must be the muscles " i was 10 year old and he was the bomb now his movies now gives me a pain in my stomach and i start to twitch , i ca n't believe how terrible an actor this man was " is " and all the money he made doing these unrealistic bull crap , wow ! talk about the american dream , i admit there are some of his movies i would have to rate a classic but however this one really sucks maybe it was the time , trend , maybe the era , but i have come a long way and this guy is a difinite no ! no ! for me , this movie had it 's moments ! for a 8 year old maybe ! for an adult you have to have a strong stomach , you i would never say this about bruce willis mybe i am a hypocrite or maybe he just an good actor duh ! i could n't care less do with this what you will i wo n't recommend it later folks	2

this software was rated the best out of a large group of digital scrapbook programs . i am very disappointed with it . first of all , my system resources ca n't handle moving the pictures so while i click and drag , the screen does n't keep up and i have no idea where the picture or item will end up . it 's not very precise this way . the website 's solution is to use my arrow keys . ok , so maybe that 's a problem with my computer . second , i ca n't select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail . and that 's with the large thumbnails . so in a photo of a group of 12 kids , i have to have the photo pre-selected . not how i planned on putting together a scrapbook when i have thousands of photos to look through . also , in researching the screen freeze issue i discovered that i can only have up to 10 pages in a scrapbook . also not my part of my original plan . my advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the faq 's before buying . it helps you to see any issues before you buy . i 'm not sure what my next selection will be , but i do n't see me using this for my scrapbooks .	5
this is the worst camera i 've ever owned . i 'm not exaggerating . i 'm so upset for wasting money on it . the only pictures that turn out , are outside in bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures in low light , there 's a high level of noise in the photos . the video mode moves in and out on its own , ruining the video . i sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos . my friend 's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	1

many reviewers compared this novel to jurassic park , saying it was a better book than crichton's . what absurdity . i am not saying that jp is an awesome book , but it was far better than tyrannosaur canyon . tyrannosaur canyon is a fairly intriguing story , but poorly executed and very poorly ended . it 's as though preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in , and did n't know how to do it . the ending is too fast , too unlikely and too unrealistic . the book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters , which i believe is preston 's way of attempting to belong to both camps , having his science and being religious . overall , i had high hopes for this book and i am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages , i was greatly let down	0
a great ending to a great series , it left me craving more . not olnly were the final revelations creatively developed the action itself was beautiful . plus mugen and jin 's final ( for the time being ) battle was great , leaving you starstruck and impressed by his ability to develope their relationship through battle . it was perfectly constructed to make you want to beg them to make another season or at least a movie	2

well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly , but if you 're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...i would n't recommend this . i was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but i have no idea what any words in the sentence / caption actually mean . i 've used it for a month know and i have no greater knowledge of chinese than when i started... .	5
i saw a commercial , i read a reviews - and so i bough one box at walmart . it 's not worth it , that 's my conclusion . the trays are made of very thin plastic-like material , and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth . the active gel easy goes out of trays , and fills your mouth . during first couple od uses , after 20 min or so i started to feel a vague pain in my gum . nevertheless , i continued using the product for all 7 days , as advertised , 30 min a day . after the whole package was gone , the change of color of my teeth is barely visible . i hope you will have better luck .	3
the first two seasons of chef ! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch . season three , however , is virtually unwatchable - they changed director , changed from film to video tape , replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history . i would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons .	2
i got the impression that rankin wrote this book in a short period of time without the assistance of a proofreader or editor . it was superficial , with such helpful hints as & quot ; people come in all sizes and shapes , & quot ; and & quot ; people with a warm smile are perceived as being more friendly . &quot ; i did n't need to read her book to figure those out . her logic is also flawed . she states that , & quot ; doctors touch patients , not vice versa because doctors are more privileged and powerful than patients . &quot ; did she consider that doctors need to touch their patients in order to examine them - not because of any power status ? using the book to promote her feminist beliefs , numerous typographical errors , and trite comments also distracted from what little substance the book had to offer	0

my wife and i both love this . in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable " head trip " than the trippers one might find in the mall . the vibrations make it better than the non-vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming . another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations . it 's a pretty simple device , sold at a reasonable cost , and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones	3
my two year old only child adores this dvd so much that she 's " adopted " max as an imaginary younger brother . there 's no flash and no dash , no special effects and no tired slapstick - but there is charm , gentleness , intelligence , humor , and completely accessible characters for the little people in your life . my daughter views max and ruby as such a treat that i used it as a potty training reward - and she 's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it . ages 18 months through five . five stars , and then some	2
this program is fantastic . it 's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events / holidays / etc. there are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs . you can also make your own card without any help . the same thing for envelopes ! there are also quite a few additional projects included . you can create your own stationary sets ( paper and envelopes ) , awards and certificates , kid 's activity pages and more . i highly recommend this program if you 're a beginner card maker . i mostly bought this ( i was a beginner ) to save money on cards and in the 2 months i 've had this program , it has more than paid for itself . it 's much more convenient than going to the store , way cheaper and i really like being able to make matching envelopes .	5
those who liked suede may be looking for more of the same from the tears , but despite the obviously recognisable vocals from brett , and the familiar wailing of bernard 's guitar , this marks a watershed in their repertoire . the most obvious difference is that all the songs seem to have been crafted as ' hits ' ( much more radio-friendly , and why not ? ) . it 's also a more mellow sound than suede ( there were fewer opportunities for vigorous bouncing and hand-clapping at the tears concert i attended ) . another important difference is the guitar work , with bernard soaring off into sonic highs not experienced since reeves gabrels and tin machine . among the better songs are apollo 13 , brave new century , refugees and co-star . though brett and bernard are capable of better , this is a shot in the arm for us disenfranchised suede-heads , and i recommend you turn it up loud	4
this thing is unbelievably lame . it does n't massage . it vibrates . y'all have sat in massage chairs before at sharper image or brookstone . they can be really good , with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage . this thing does n't even resemble those chairs . trust me . i am sitting in one now . it is my main office chair . i have not turned on the " massage " function , or even plugged it in , since about three days after i bought it . the " massage " feature is more like an annoy feature . it just shakes you around a bit , but does n't actually feal good in any way .	3
this just to voice my opinion on the new ran transfer . while i agree it is an improvement over the atrocious fox lorber edition ( which is not that great an achievement considering the fox lorber dvd was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment ) , this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice . yes , the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement ( straight from hell ! ) does n't make it any better . i have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than ran but look far better . the problem becomes very obvious when one watches this dvd via progressive component output on a large screen - a video tape was used as a master ( and a poor one at that ) . the only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing mr. kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative , before applying filters or any enhancements . why this opportunity was ( again ) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much . another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video , which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer . for my part , i would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a " saucy " soft picture without much " bite " and detail . there is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement . and yes , the packaging is a liability - my dvds must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the atlantic and looked accordingly . shocking . i would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right : the image quality of ran . like this , i 'm very disappointed	2
this product could put user / customer 's life at risk . the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road . this is the worst product that i have used in my life .	5
this cd offers a great deal of incredible music by john lennon during 1969 and the early 1970 's when he fought our government in order for him and yoko to live in the united states . the quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this cd you want to run to watch the film ! the cd starts off strong with " power to the people . " the song makes its political statement and offers a great beat that sticks in your mind . it is also very upbeat and aggressive in its tone which attracts the listener immediately to make them want more . the listener wo n't be disappointed . the tracks that follow provide great insight into john 's politics at the same time that he provides us with his singularly beautiful music . great songs on this cd include the autobiographical " nobody told me " in which john admits that his struggle with our government both to end the vietnam war and to remain in the usa is harder than he thought it would be . " working class hero " has a folksy , bluesy feel to it but then the cd goes right back to that unique john lennon rock and roll flavor with the song " i found out . " " bed peace " follows as a type of introduction to the only beatles song on this cd , " the ballad of john & yoko . " despite the catchy rock and roll beat to " the ballad of john & yoko , " the lyrics tell the sad story of how people harass john and yoko . another great song is " give peace a chance ; " the message here is obvious . " love , " " imagine , " and " oh my love " are beautiful ballads with excellent musical arrangements ; and we get a new instrumental version of " how do you sleep " that is very well done . in addition , i like the two live tracks from the john sinclair freedom rally in 1971. " attica state " is a brand new release and " john sinclair " packs a strong punch ! these tracks demonstrate so well john 's ability to connect with his audience in a live setting . one special song on this cd directly challenges each and every listener to personal reflection and insight : " happy xmas ( war is over ) . " john and yoko tell people to know the difference between the blessings of peace and the evils of war , to cherish what is morally right and to fight against anything that is morally wrong . the song also expresses hope for a peaceful future beyond the current christmas season . " happy xmas ( war is over ) " continues to play on radio stations every christmas season to this day . yes , another amazon reviewer correctly notes that yoko talks a little bit over the very beginning of the song " oh my love . " thank goodness that she does n't talk over the lyrics ! a few brief dialogue excerpts from the film are peppered throughout the cd but they never overlap with the songs . the cd ends with the same strength that it started with : " instant karma ! ( we all shine on ) " is an excellent song that most lennon fans will always love . the liner notes include some great black and white pictures of john and yoko , including two from the infamous " bed-in . " you get the song credits along with the year that each song was released and there is a brief essay by yoko ono herself . overall , this cd is more than just a retrospective of john 's music during a turbulent period in his life . oh sure , almost all of this music has been previously released . however , that 's not relevant here . the cd celebrates lennon 's ability to communicate his political beliefs through his songs . these songs remind us to avoid genocide , to be true to oneself and to strive for peace- -now . i highly recommend this cd for lennon fans , fans of great 1970s rock music and anyone who wants to experience how john lennon taught us what was right through his music .	4
i think his debut had the best lyrics . this joint gets off to a good start with we still party and pretty much bangs till the end . his production on here is best described as " late 90 's roger troutman-esque g-funk " . geust stars like 2nd ii none , amg , suga free and el debarge get their shine on . top joints : we still party ( peter gunz and quik on the track ) quik jacks the verb song from school house rock . ( the jam ) so many wayz hand in hand you'z a ganxta ( quik refutes rumors that he was involved in biggie 's demise . also denounces reference to death in rap songs . ) i useta know her ( should be called i useta hit that ) speed medley for a ' v ' ( the p***y medley ) get 2getha again ( class of 91 , 2nd ii none , amg and quik triple team on this track . ) reprise ( medley for a ' v )	4
overall i was pleased with ease of installation . this was an upgrade from office 2003. i backed up all files before upgrade , and always do this , but it was not necessary for this upgrade . my overall disappointment is outlook 's inability or difficulty to use other mail servers ( yahoo , gmail , etc. ) . the shift appears to favor msn products only ( hotmail and msn ) . no wonder thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application	5
i ordered this product on june 7th 2006 , today is july 11th 2006 , and i still have not received it . i have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it , than to wait over a month for it to show up . i 'm really not happy with the turn around time for the tide he detergent .	3
in 2 weeks , i will actually be at the vatican for my first visit.this wonderful dvd showed me places and things that i will never be able to see as a tourist , but just knowing about the workings of the vatican will add such a richness of knowledge to visit . this is a beautifully done 90 min dvd as only national geographic could have done . i was thrilled with every minute i spent watching it and will enjoy watching it many more time when i get home - - - to remember my trip .	2
this is a great show and very entertaining . the story is n't the greek classic , but it 's a fine riff on it . the songs are good , and they grow on you as you watch . i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character - it 's just a cartoon , for pete 's sake . like some other reviewers , i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing " go the distance " over the end credits , but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version , " no importa la distancia , " sung by ricky martin , and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money	2
i 've been using studio for years and while i definitely had reliability problems with studio 10.0 , 10.6 has been very reliable , and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better . i tried premiere elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things , and it was much slower burning a simple dvd image , and it simply does n't do hd which i 've started playing with . i 'm sticking with studio and i make a dvd just about every week with my kids ' videos . i do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean	5
in my 1-3-2007 review of the harry potter dvd series , i said about alfonso cuarón 's direction of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban that " perhaps cuarón held back from doing his own thing " because chris columbus had directed the previous harry potter releases and had oversight to azkaban . well the notion that cuarón was holding back in his potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing children of men . cuarón can indeed make a great movie and could have made azkaban great...but it was just good . greatness clearly shines through when cuarón is turned loose with " his own " film , and children of men is a good example . children of men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith . and this is apparently what cuarón does best ( see 2001 directorial of oscar nominated y tu mamá también ) . in children of men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born . the result ? chaos . clearly the end of the world is near . zombies might as well have taken over the earth , and it was that zombie movie ( you know , the good ones , like 28 days later [2002] or dawn of the dead [2004] ) desperation that i was reminded of throughout children of men . cuarón adapts p.d. james ' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties , but keeps the message pretty much the same . the story is believably told , and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through . clive owen leads the cast , and this guy just gets better and better in every film that i see him in . he 's supported by julianne moore , michael caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in a-list performances . a fair amount of action . suspense . a very well-told story....everything that you need to keep you entertained . and , hey , did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for children of men ? you do n't get that too often anymore .	2
i am so pleased with this purchase ! ! under normal circumstances if i spend anything over $1.00 i get caught in a spiral of buyers regret . this is a feeling that i have grown accustomed to . when i received the 800 , 000 through the mail i shredded open the box and started skimming through what new images i could play with . i was astonished ! then , i realized something.....or rather a lack of something . i felt no remorse for buying this ! i finally had a collection of clip art that could provide an abundant amount of images for collages , labels , calendars , scrapbooks , and everything else i wanted to do .	5
although this game maybe aimed for kids , it can still offer powerful training games in an entertaining way . each assorted machines is like an arcade that trains each tactical aspects individually . such as blind chess , eye-training , memory training of chess positions are most notable that separates it from the other beginner chess training programs . the only thing i hate bout this game is the lack of options . you ca n't log off to a different username without having to shutdown the program first then relog nor can you delete usernames . no bgms ( backgroundmusic ) during chess matches . other than that , its an awesome tactical training tool . kids really do love to play this game and is one of the best games out there that can get them into playing chess . i think chess can be a beneficial contribution to school learning and thinking process .	5
it was my full belief that the next time we would hear from buju banton on an album would be on the now 2 years anticipated ` rasta got soul ' album . the album which has still yet to arrive ( and may never ) was said to be along buju 's best and might actually rival his seminal classic ` til shiloh . he even tipped his hand 2 years ago by releasing the album 's first single , the ` magical ' magic city . so the world was waiting to see just how much soul the album had . however . between then and now buju has been going through so many events that this album , too bad , almost seems like a smack in the face to his critics . forever , it seems that he is still living in the ` boom bye bye curse ' , and having some legal matters which prevented him traveling , he apparently has been angered by all the unwanted attention and the result is too bad . the album has a severe kick to it , it can actually sit not too far away from his ` stablemate ' assassin 's infiltrate from ` 05 , in terms of style . the attraction here is actually the subject of ` confusion' . while we were waiting for a massive roots album to come down the pipe , buju has n't made a pure dancehall album in a very very long time . thus , the dj who was once the dancehall 's main attraction stepping back into the fray is n't at all a bad thing . so fans who sit longing for the days of stamina daddy and batty rider are the one 's who 'll be happy and i can fit into that camp as well ! but at the same time , buju 's concentration for the last decade or so has been the roots , so now it is there where he will ultimately excel . however , with the current trend in dancehall to revive older riddims , you may find yourself feeling like 1991 all over again . the best tune here is probably the hard hard ` til it bend . til it bend is serious serious rudey dancehall . the song might sound like the rest to the untrained ear , but i guarantee that is the song most jamaican will pull up , til it bend is nice ! also check the wicked wicked nothing , who have it ? , the ultra clever better day and the nice hey boy over the petty thief riddim . however , my second favorite song here i would have to say would be the combination don & dupes with underrated dancehall singer pinchers who has been making a very very nice return to the scene recently , largely due to his connection with madhouse head , dave kelly . buju makes an attempt ( for some reason ) at the useless wipeout riddim on me & unu and actually makes it work a little . also check when things slow down on nice tunes such as driver , which is easily one of the best tunes on the album . overall , the thought alone , buju doing another dancehall album may have some salivating and some wondering where the roots is , this one may appeal to both group of hardcore fans . while there is nothing here that i would call definitive roots reggae , this album has such an old school vibes to it that anyone who has ever been a fan of buju 's will find something they like . i would have like to have seen buju have at least one lenky riddim on the album , a wayne wonder combination ( although pinchers subs just fine ) and definitely the massive song beauty queen from the twice again riddim would have fit just fine here , but nevertheless , what you do have : high quality dancehall from one of the greatest architects of that skill is just fine and too bad , over both what beenie and baby cham have done , is the best pure dancehall album of 2006 to date , and a boomshot in the arm for the genre	4
jimi hendrix was an ideal guitarist to lead a power trio , and he thrived in that format . he inspired other groups to attempt it , with varying degrees of success . but the experience was a unit , able to soar on stage in extended live versions of hendrix 's compositions . had it not been for the demon of discontent within the trio itself ( that curses so many otherwise excellent bands ) , the experience might have created several more inspired albums than it did before falling apart . the album band of gypsys was jarring upon its release to those of us looking for hendrix to continue to maximize the potential of the experience . at the time , loosely associated groups that traded off lengthy lead parts in a more or less generic old-style blues format were common and certainly not original - - much less cutting edge . it 's true that jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him , but there 's an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance . buddy miles became a kind of intrusion into the world jimi had fashioned in his previous work . on a hendrix album , songs sung by buddy miles did n't move the bar ; they did not elucidate jimi 's universe . buddy 's drum work was simply not in the style of mitch mitchell , and that was a large step down from the experience 's innovative grooves in songs like " fire , " for example . listen to " fire , " and then listen to any cut on " band of gypsys . " listen to hendrix 's wild half-sung , half-wailed vocals on the previous albums , and then listen to buddy miles sing " changes . " you ca n't reconcile the two styles , and that would not be quite so bad if it were n't for the obvious fact that band of gypsys , under buddy miles ' unfortunate influence , were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by jimi 's previous work in tracks like " are you experienced ? " and " third stone from the sun . " jimi 's guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf . band of gypsys turned jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band , which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman buddy miles . that 's not what people bought a hendrix album for . it just did n't work very well as a release from what people still considered the hendrix experience . jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow , and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point . no doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove , but the cohesion of the experience , the clear creative identity of the hendrix experience was not there . you can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed noel redding and mitch mitchell , and that may be true . but whatever the line-up , people were not entirely ready for jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players .	4
i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so on the box , but it doesn't . it works just like the old contacts which you ca n't share with others except if you export it . no live sharing . why could n't they make it so i could put the file on my server ? or on a secure site ? then all my office can work off one contact list . 50% or more of the time the business contacts ca n't be found when you search for a contact . it 's like the business contacts is an add in that does n't work with outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone . also , lots of times when you try to send , the email wo n't send , it stays in the outbox . and repeatedly you open and hit the send button but it wo n't change to send status . now , if you leave it in the outbox , sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you can forward and send. . geez , what a waste of money this upgrade was . we wo n't be using it on any of our other computers and we have n't bought if on the new computers we have ordered .	5
honestly , i do n't know how much more they can improve adobe acrobat . it is an excellent product , and a god-send for electronic file management . i upgraded from version 6.0. the only problem i had with 6.0 is that it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , and files seem to " print " to it much more quickly than version 6.0. i do not utilize the " one-button " feature it provides in ms office and other programs . i try to keep all my programs as non-integrated as possible , because my previous experiences showed that they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i do n't come close to using all the features of acrobat , but for my needs , it far surpasses anything else i 've tried ( or researched ) . if you 're having problems with version 6.0 , or have an older version that you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i do n't foresee ever needing to upgrade acrobat again	5
well you know the drill . some people will like anything that is " artsy " or " out of the ordinary " or " made by that great director " . its a different kind of herd but a herd nevertheless . the movie is about incest . it is about sex and adolescence . and , ironically , it is some kind of a parody of the very crowd that is giving this movie rave reviews . the best part of this movie is eva green . or , more precisely , eva green 's body . i did n't care about her acting ( i thought it was mediocre ) . i just sat there and drunk her body in , wishing that i was that lucky actor ( whats his name again ? ) . the only reason to watch this movie is eva green . if she was indeed exploited by the elderly director with an intimidating reputation , then i am glad it happened . the movie is visually rich . in fact , its so rich that bertolucci seems to be masturbating his sensibilities for us all to see . but i will take it . he captures and celebrates eve green 's stunning body - every square millimeter of it ( including her genitals - the movie is nc17 for a reason ) , to perfection . other than that , there is nothing else in the movie . the story is utterly insipid , the old movie clips , the " discussion " of morality or whatever ... nothing interesting . the music is another plus point . bottomline , watch it for eva green 's body . it deserves five stars . but the movie deserves only two	2
after i watched this sequel i realized it was not as good as the first but i did enjoy it .	2
every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading , and look for a surprise , or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset i picked up " would n't take nothing for my journey now . " and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration ? ehh.. . ms. angelou may not take anything for her journey , but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it , and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland , her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause , this book is dreadful . if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook ; i.e. , about boundaries , respect , finding ones direction , learning what it means to be a women , etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is , you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere	0
the characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional , the dialog hackneyed . i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list . it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else . do n't waste your money	0

i got secret story as a christmas present last year . i had asked for imaginary day , because the only tune i had heard from pat metheny was " the roots of coincidence , " and i was itching for more . i still could n't wait to hear what was on secret story , but i was hoping it would be in the same vain as the roots of coincidence . what i ended up hearing was an incredible cd with a vast scope , filled with emotions that change from tune to tune . searching for tunes to sound like roots was not successful ; instead , i joyfully found a complete and very unique set . i agree with others that for maximum experience you should have enough time to listen to it in one sitting , straight through . the musical roller coaster is the most extravagant when done this way . i found myself trying to pick out favorite tunes , but i ended up picking ones for only a particular " mood " ( such as an upbeat or sedative one ) . i could just as easily pick a few different tunes for another mood . that 's why it 's fun to listen to it straight through : no other album of mine gives me so much in so little time . of course , metheny has apparently mastered the flow of the tracks , too : one leads right into the next , creating , oh , maybe a " story ? " i do n't know the story , but it 's a lot of fun to make up a different story each time you listen to it . i guess the tune that i most like to play , no matter what mood i 'm in , is " cathedral in a suitcase , " with it 's mesmerizing 3-against-2 beat and a well-crafted three-chord progression that it revolves around . tunes range from the euphoric ( cathedral , finding and believing , facing west , the truth will always be ) , to the sweet ( the longest summer , sunlight , always and forever ) , to the smooth ( rain river , antonia , as a flower blossoms , see the world ) , to the calm and reflective ( above the treetops , tell her you saw me , not to be forgotten ) . of course , this is all the tunes , and it makes for such a satisfying experience . since this is my first metheny cd , i am definitely going to pursue more . metheny seems worth my time and money	4
this film seems a lot better than kodak max 400 even though it is basically the same thing ( except for the fact that it 's black and white ) . i would n't recommend this for proffesionals , but it 's great for the average person	1
nothing in this book was usable for me . okay , very little . if i was trying to write the next _ethan frome_ , then this book would be perfect . instead i write sci-fi and fantasy . i was looking for tips to improve my description of things ; this book recommends describing different things . too much emphasis on metaphor ( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious ) . if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate , this book might be a waste of your time . however , poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than i did	0
live alive is good enough to buy in my standered's .....i really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car , or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better . their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence 's spanning from performences from montreux jazz festival , austin opera house , and the dallas starfest . this recordings are all from 85-through 86. jimmie vaughan appears on willie the wimp , love struck baby , look at little sister , and change it playing guitar , and string bass . i think the worst song on the entire complination is voodoo chile ( slight return ) which is kind of weird for me to say because i think that was truely the best song stevie ray played live but in this case its not . other than that i really think for what it is it 's a average live performence .	4
what can i say ? more spidey than you can shake a stick at for peanuts . if you ever wished you had the patience to cut out and neatly collect all the sunday paper comics in a nice neat scrap book then this is the book for you . i 'm planning on buying the lot and thoroughly enjoying my strolls down memory lane	0
i could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern 's classic - while the set design and special fx are state of the art , as usual for a tim burton film , the actual movie is hard to watch . why ? depp 's " performance " is chock full of ticks and mannerisms , off-putting , flat , self-absorbed , and finally , one-note . rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version , burton 's film is more horror than fantasy , often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare . while deliberate on burton 's part , that does n't make the final product any more watchable . it 's one grim , dismal , downward spiral slog . not much holidday fun , huh ? as with most of burton 's other big , expensive failures , he knows how to create a convincing world , but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with and / or could care less about . the final result is a film that 's like a fragile , hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar , but hard to get attached to , much less involved with . what a waste of millions of studio $$$	2
this is anything but soothing . the tone is too high pitched ; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky carmel coastline that i was hoping for . i did buy the twofer and got the ocean surf cd by dan gibson and found it much more relaxing , even though it is n't a tumbling surf sound . i was able to fall asleep.. . which was my goal . now if i could only return ocean waves .	4
i 've had other razors and believe me , this one is the most reliable on i 've had ! it works well , does not hurt ? ( maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one ? ) a feature i like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times i need this before i use the regular cutter . battery life is acceptable , power is good , and just a few swipes is all you need . you really ca n't compare a blade razor to an electric - they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used . this razor , however , has a better level of shaving than other electrics , closer to a blade than the others . in convenience an electric is much better than any blade - you can use it anywhere , dry , just sittin ' around	3
i do n't think customer lee kane is quite right when he says that tag gallagher 's labour-of-love book is mainly about the films . gallagher 's writing is spare and lean but he gives at least as much biography as the purely biographical books	0
this device worked about 80% of the time on myself and only about 10% of the time on my father . unfortunately , it was a christmas gift for him and not for me . we ended up getting a self inflating one at circuit city that seems to be working just fine . it is possible that the problem lies with him - possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at cc worked just fine	3
this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii , but otherwise its just a mess . the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble , but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes , who also gave us such film masterpieces as " casino royale " and " chitty chitty bang bang " . richard harris is his usually unrestrained self , and thats not a compliment . now , i wont even go into the politics , which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero : as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas 's paean to charles ii in " twenty years after " , but nowhere near as entertaining .	2
( this review is of the spyware edition ) nis takes 25megs of ram - ok for an all-in-one ( if you have & lt ; 256megs your lightweight cpu ca n't carry enough armor to make windows really zero-day net safe imho ) nis has most of the features i look for in a firewall / spyware / virus scanner / intrusion detector , but half do n't work right , and some that do seem to fight every attempt to make them work . even after liveupdate this week , one buggy automatic firewall rule autoloaded , and port 80 was open listening half ' naked ' on the internet . i replaced it , and at the first passing probe my rule was erased , autoreplaced , naked again . only after i stumbled onto the secret trick ( add a block all rule after the pass rules ) did it close it . it took 11 clicks ( ! ) just to add the block all rule - miserable ! the log is a nightmare - pages of long sentences explaining " permitted once " 200 times , no actual info until i click on one of them . what 's worse is , none of them i checked were " permitted once " iirc . nis detected 2 trojan / spywares , but could not remove either . enabling program component monitoring started an avalanche of popups , all suggesting i block access , but i actually do want ie to access the internet . running windows update brought a popup asking if 100 's more dll 's are ok . how would i know ? i do want windows updated . great feature in theory , totally useless even if you know the names of every evil dll not yet invented . if you have more than 1 or 2 programs not in the automatic ruleset , plan to either " permit all " or spend many hours actually writing the same set of 3 rules over and over for every autoupdating program you use - assuming you understand tcp vs udp etc. why no " permit all local + dns + outbound port 80 " choice ? that would mean 1 / 10 the work ! jetico lets me pick " web browser " ruleset , so its ui from hell gets used once per category . after spending all day and half the night getting it working , i discover that it is not possible to save my precious rules - or to reload them . i would be less furious if i had a fresh install of windows , but not much . all good , until a program autoupdates , and 3 more rules to write . too angry for words . jetico lets me clone the old rules or edit them to update the program sig . i would not use nis if you paid me 10 times its price .	5
not only is this beauty wide , i have found the lens is very sharp to on my d200 ! it is built solid and focus 's fast , and i do n't have any problem with distortion because i use dxo optics software and it cleans it up automaticly ! buy this lens , it is cheap for what you get	1
well , the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great [compared to other battery operated shavers]. i agree . my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each . google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries . some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys	3
i have found another product that i want to recommend . it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon , but you can also go the starlight website and order it . it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters , and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i 'm using it . they also have a product specifically for weight loss . i have tried that as well . i did feel a bit jittery at first.. . but it settled after a week or so of taking it . i would recommend it also . i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs . i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss , but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings . i 'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need ... energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it . i 've used this for years and have not had any problems .	3
i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films . to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection . i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film . but i was very disappointed to say the least . the movie takes place in the early eighties . when gangs dressed in leather with chains , carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally . this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in . if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	2
do n't be fooled by the box saying how many they 've sold anyone who knows anything about software knows you cannot return an opened software box so sold means nothing . this software in unimpressive , i bought it because i needed to do my wedding invitation and i liked the description thinking i could use it for may other things as well . well i ended up using word for my invitations , yes word , why because word actually did everything i wanted that this program said it would do but did n't ! i spent hours trying to use it 's " simple " templates to no avail they would not print correctly or in the size they claimed to be . in the end i am out the money i spent and pretty mad about it	5

in answer to a music fan from temple hills , the song was called king holiday by the king dream chorus & amp ; holiday crew . it came out on mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned . it made no.30 on the r&amp ; b charts but did n't crossover pop . the lyrics are on the net ( try google ) but i do n't know if the song still is	4
what really good fun ! ! my whole family enjoyed these dvds to the fullest . really wonderful , with the feeling of rome and a personalized view of the history . we often travel to italy and this was a " taste " without the trip	2
i will not repeat what other reviews have stated already , all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc. the only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a rolex watch . it is hard even in manual mode ( and i actually have alot of digital camera experience ) . forget trying to focus in auto mode , it wo n't happen. . at least not without alot of tinkering and stress . if you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc. ) then i recommend buying a digital slr camera , nikon d50 is a good one ! this fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc	1
i used to have respect for bill maher . he used to actually inspire me when it came to being brave enough to argue my own opinions without making apologies ; but not anymore . my respect dissipated as his fairness was replaced by blinding hatred for gwb and religion . i watched " i 'm swiss " once and almost could n't refrain from vomiting . he talks about the usual suspects : the president , religion , obesity , same-sex marriage , rap , and few other things that " comedians " are good at joking about and liberals are good at preaching about . i know , i know , he 's not a liberal , he 's a libertarian . well , i have watched and listened to bill maher and i know which side he 's on most of the time , and it sure is n't on the right . he hates organized religion and traditional morality too much to be on the right much of the time . i do n't know why his panties are in such a bunch . being organized is better than being disorganized ( i can tell jokes too ) . i 'm not religious ; and i ca n't help but see much of it as hard to swallow , but i 'm not arrogant enough to call all of it just a bunch of fairytales created and believed by people with neurological disorders . i was n't there when the bible was written or when the events took place . i ca n't say it 's all fairtyales . i can only say some of it is n't logical . but , i respect religion and its purposes ; which is what separates me from him . he has no qualms about crushing the hope of people who believe in an afterlife or religion , which are both things that make life more bearable for them . the purpose of religion is to provide hope and solace and relief to people who are living in desperation . the same purpose of drugs i might add : something maher not only defends but abuses . why the double standard ? this is no longer the eleventh century where protestants are killing catholics . the only people k / illing in the name of religion are fanatical muslims , but most religious people are good , decent , nonviolent individuals . maher 's not an atheist , but he has recently expressed a " could be , could be not " attitude toward the existence of a g / od , which would make him agnostic . but one thing is for sure , atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does . two of our biggest mass murderers- -hitler and stalin- -were atheist . it 's a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than maher , who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one . most of the time , he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself . i laughed twice during the entire show . no one has ever accused maher of being modest . he 's a smug , intellectual elitist . and those are his good qualities . " i 'm swiss " displays this all too clearly . in case you did n't know , " i 'm swiss " is a running joke of maher 's embarrassment of being an american . he 'd rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for , not an extension of , morality ; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all ; where adultery is seen as cute , not sinful ; where there are no fat people ; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions . thank god i live in america and not switzerland .	2
& quot ; monkey business&quot ; looks pretty good on dvd 50 years later . the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought , a bit darkly tinted , and more defined . the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout . marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here . she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss does n't like her punctuation . cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance , getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth . his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ! ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth . if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions , it 'd be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings . hugh marlowe as the straight-laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game . oscar winner charles coburn ( 1943 , the more the merrier ) does a great job of appreciating monroe 's assets as oliver oxly , the ceo . kathleen freeman as mrs. brannigan gives a fine performance . the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films . this is a great little piece of cinematic history . turn back the clock & amp ; enjoy	2
i recommend that you not buy this product through the mail . my three boxes leaked all over the amazon box . yuck	3

polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image . i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare , but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some " pop " out of clouds . there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs . for instance , linear vs. circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs. price . if you are making use of a ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers are designed to work with those features . linear polarizers has their uses , but they are manufactured differently and may not work . unless you are certain , just get a circular polarizing filter . there are some digital circular polarizers on the market . i am not sure what makes a cir-pl lens better for digital as opposed to film . i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non-digital filter on a digital camera . most of the time , when it comes to filters ; you get what you pay for . does that mean you need an expensive polarizer ? of course not , just be sure to get the right filter for your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting . spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money by using step down rings . currently i use the hoya pro1 filters , as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier . the weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly . i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me . when it came down to the images , at times i would see a browning tint on my photos . the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 , but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it is canon , it must be quality . " since then i have replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters . pros : can be used for film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections and ghosting cons : bulky and heavy not neutral color balance	1
this collection brings together five of the older british war stories and is excellent value for anyone who enjoys such movies	2
not a fan of graphic novels or cgi , i was fully prepared to dislike this movie , but found it to be so well written , cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection . it 's a dark movie , subversive really , but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people , that one strong person with a will , determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them , can turn the tide . it 's a powerful message , and it 's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery , symbolism and script . bravo	2
this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday . she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet . i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors . i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now . impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing .	2
this program is average to below average in it 's abilities . that said , just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support . why ? because roxio 's support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or by email for help ; whenever their dis-functional " web portal " [web-based support] system traps you in an endless loop . i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet . it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access . then burn patch[s] to a cd , or copy to floppy / jumpdrive . then " sneakernet " the patches to the pc needing them . no more . what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download / patch a roxio product directly on my pc . [ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc]. instead of simply letting me download it somewhere , like to my hard drive , vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc , [which wo n't work in my case as i 'm not using roxio , nor have it installed on my pc] ; apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download / patch process stop / end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page . when you need a patch , all these endless loops and support games are enough to get me looking for a different product / different company . if you want to minimize human contact with customers , fine . but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going . do n't hand over your customer support system [almost] completely to a web server . that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls . then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem . it just does n't work . if a company wo n't provide access to patches , even after i have logged into their website with username and password , [so they know is accessing their patches] and they do n't offer any type of ftp site as a download backup option , then i sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products . i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies . [though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that]. when a competitor has a better product , why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality / features , when you can buy the other company out . thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella .	5
when i was a senior in high school i decided to take correspondence courses instead of attending a regular school . this was the text used for my creative writing class . i absolutely loved it and have been trying to snag a copy of it ever since . this book is great at giving you ideas for how to make up your own work of fiction even if you never tried before . i would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing where their imagination can take them	0
to add on to the previous reviewers , i was very disappointed with this camera 's performance . i compared the " 5 megapixel " photos with photos taken with my canon , powershot g3 ( 4megapixels ) , and the scd6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills . the camera itself also seemed flimsy . the idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive . but another attractive concept , canon 's elura50 , offered a camcorder with a compact design . in the end , however , it broke down only after a year and a half . for a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan ( cf. reviews for elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems ) . this camera seemed less durable than the elura50 as i maneuvered the various parts and dials . of course , i am returning the camera before it can prove its durability . nevertheless , maybe the folks at cnet can stake their money on it . lastly , i should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed . i found that i had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button . this definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments . again , this camera is a great idea . but , i suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording . this one is on the right track , but , still so far from accomplishing a quality product .	1
" the guitars are n't loud enough , and neither is the bass for that matter " which is so true , but it 's still a great album . seeing them live , makes up for this cd no doubt . stand out songs : -the city sleeps in flames -the world as we know it -just a taste -my darkest hour -empty glasses -the only medicine ' my darkest hour ' & ' empty glasses ' are my favorites . i know those songs by heart	4
i found this program simple , easy to operate . however , when creating a dvd project i used a narration for my audio . the narration matched each picture perfectly , when i decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off . do not count on any tech support . they offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all . you have the option of forking over $35 per incident in order to get a real live person on the phone - but it still does not guarantee it will help . and now , i 'm not even able to burn it ! ! ! ! i hate this program	5
& quot ; modern&quot ; usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the cars , flock of seagulls , or somesuch . it is not a punk record , mostly midtempo pop . the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful ; shelley 's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks . i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff ; newbies should buy & quot ; operator 's manual&quot ; or & quot ; going steady . &quot ; or dig up the amazing & quot ; different kind of tension&quot ; from a used record store somewhere ! also , see them live if you have a chance	4
maybe it 's just me , but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie . it 's an incredibly small production ( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film ) , with very low production values . norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker , but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest , either . ( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie . ) if you are an alan rickman fan , chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them . and dark harbor is just one more of these . do n't let the promise of a " nude scene " convince you to buy this movie - honestly , alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on . as far as the movie is concerned , the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging . it is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off .	2
item received in perfect condition . checked with doctor . very good blood pressure monitor . thank you	3
terms of endearment captivates me with the believable relationship of mother and daughter as brilliantly portrayed by shirley maclaine and debra winger . it covers approximately 30 years of the turbulent yet loving relationship between mom aurora and daughter emma . they have their differences ; yet the love between them is always so obvious . it 's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other , even their sex lives . i 've seen this movie several times , and everytime i cry at the end . in spite of the death , the movie ends on a positive note , giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay . the budding relationship between aurora and her neighbor ( also brilliantly portrayed by jack nicholson ) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between emma and her husband and children . the most interesting aspect is that emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her , when she has been cheating on him as well . somehow though we sympathize with emma and her gentle lover ( played by the very talented john lithgow ) . we feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship does n't seem wrong . if you are in the mood for a movie that is entertaining and gut-wrenching at the same time , this is a perfect choice	2
the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well . the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow . it is abrasive to the skin . i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem . the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly . other than that , it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many	3
this is not a high-tech digital frame . it does n't play mp3's . it does n't come with a remote . it simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode . there 's an " on " button and an " off " button . there is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame ( though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet ) . it 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off . if you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location , or choreograph your pictures with music , then this is not the frame for you	1
the game disk does not run on my laptop . but it will play it on my desktop computer . very annoying , but at least i can play ( other reviewers have not been so lucky ) . the game has some good questions and i enjoy testing my friends knowledge . the game itself is rather simple and not totally fun . the " game board " is the outside of the friends ' apartment building . when you get a question right a window lights up . when you get one wrong a window dims . if you do n't answer the question nothing happens . you win when all the windows on that floor are lit up . i would prefer that they make you answer all questions - none of this passing on a question - it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement . if you play a multi-player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard ! it 's silly for the two players to be huddled together , hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart . there are some video clips and still images accompanying the questions , but it 's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments . think trivial pursuit with a computer screen as the cards . this game was a gift . if i had to do it over again i 'd probably spend my money instead on scene it ! friends edition . as of right now , scene it ! friends edition is on sale at circuit city for the same price as this game is on amazon . ( and though i have n't played it , the reviews of that game are much better than this one ) .	5
to start - i miss my hair . last september i cut my hip length hair to mid back , and then in december to just at the shoulders , and then again to the chin in january - and from january through june i trimmed it regularly to keep it that length . ( i 've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - i could n't get it out via any other method tried except " growing out " ) . my hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster , but i suppose everything slows down the older you get . my last cut was late june - and it was at mid to upper neck length - basically a little bit longer than the chin length cut , and then layered . that got rid of the really saturated henna 'd hair - so i was ready to start growing it out . after much digging around online i came across hair 37 and all the reviews on it - both good and bad . i gave it a shot - got my pills in the first week of july and started taking them . last night - maybe it was wishful thinking , but i noticed a difference in the hair length - it seemed it 'd picked up a little length a little extra quickly - and then my boyfriend commented on it later that day . he knows i 've been working to go back to my natural hair color - and there 's a noticeable demarcation line from the henna and the natural hair color . last night he looked at me and said " hey wow - you 're hair 's really grown - i can see a half inch more of the roots ! wow - you 're hair is getting dark ! " i was pretty pleased with that - not bad for just 2 weeks on the vitamins ! i ca n't wait to see how it is in another 2 weeks , come august - if i have another 1 / 2 inch to add to it , i will definitely be reordering these pills ! but a side note , from previous reviews and my own experience.. . it 's a lot of pills to take - but make sure you keep up with them every day . i find taken a stage one pill at morning and afternoon , and then dividing up the stage 2 pills into 3 doses of 2 pills throughout the day works very well .	3
the only good thing on this dvd are the interview segments with gidget gein . this was the most boring dvd i have ever watched and i actually started to fall asleep the first time i attempted to watch it	2
i really enjoyed this film , basically the coen bros . homage to the film noir genre . ( i always thought the name was funny , since it 's french , and yet most of famous directors were german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc. : - ) ) . the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton is great in the lead as the reticent , phlegmatic barber , and if anything , he is even more convincing with hair than without- -even his hairpiece is 50s-ish . : - ) the whole cast does a fine job in their roles , and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show-stealing scenes . i found the film 's climax a complete surprise , as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber , for whom everything seems to be working out up till then . overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros . best . if you 're a coen bros . fan you wo n't find this one a disappointment .	2
i have to admit that i actually enjoyed this movie . i certainly liked it better than " red planet " . i believe " mission to mars " to be the better of the two movies . it has a stellar cast and , i thought , good on screen chemistry between the actors . most of the special effects were excellent . all in all , it is a good directorial effort by brian de palma . somehow , however , this has become the movie that viewers love to hate . well , i am afraid that i disagree , as i found it to be a pretty decent sci-fi move . of course , i am partial to this genre of film , so perhaps that may account in part for my liking this movie . the premise of this movie is simple . a crew is sent on a mission to mars . the mission is disrupted when three of the four crew members are killed by an unknown energy force emanating from a strange metallic composition in the soil . a new crew of four go on a rescue mission . these four , tim robbins , connie nielsen , gary sinise , and jerry o'connell , make up the rescue crew . due to problems encountered in space , only three of the four make it to mars . when they get to mars , they find the surviving crew member . debriefing him of the events that led to the destruction of the mission , they discover that the metallic composition in the soil is , in fact , a giant metallic head made in the image of man . therein lies the mystery . what they eventually discover astounds them and makes one of them decide to go where no man has gone before . the ending is somewhat reminiscent of a combination of the movies , " 2001 : a space odyssey " and " close encounters of the third kind . " so , i ask you , how bad can this movie be ? on the contrary , it is actually pretty good . better yet , it can be watched by the entire family	2
no use thumbing the pages of cale 's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography , ' what 's welsh for zen ? , to glean hard data on this one melodic gem . coming after the heady , if problematic days of the velvets , there 's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format . the abrasive thrashing rock of ' mcbeth ' ( while indicating his imminent direction ) serves the one discordant note . throughout , cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past . language had been severed from lineal meaning , in rock , since bob went electric . pete brown writing for jack bruce 's towering masterpieces , ' songs for a sailor ' , & ' harmony row ' ; keith reid with procul harum , were mixing up the lyric medicine , presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with ' paris 1919' . that date ? the birth of surrealism , ( and similar writing to cale 's efforts herein ) perhaps ? the russian revolution ? cale 's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it , which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs ; stretched out vowells on , ' planing lakes ' , ' elephants that sing ' , ' looking out from here at half past france . ' it was far from banal music , however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings , viola & piano cale painted . these lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung . ' locusts ' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness . ' fragments of a rainy season ' is a good retrospective concert . and some of the fuge written around the hommage to andy warhol is very moving stuff . go john	4
amazon 's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it . i will never buy from amazon again . i bought over 100 items over 5 years . i purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan . they then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer 's needs . i cancelled order 2 days before it ships , they say sorry we cannot cancel . 2 days ? ? ? come-on . i guess the $3000 just creates nice interest . the end for me and amazon , i do not like this kind of " aggressive marketing " . good advice , rather buy direct from b&h photo , pay double if you like , but you will get what you pay for there , not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms . i am truly annoyed . run , hide .	1
this is a poorly designed camera case . you have to take the camera out of the case completely each time you shoot pictures . i expected the case to remain on the camera body and just uncover the lens so you can shoot . i was very disappointed . this is rather a leather box than a camera case	1
i purchased this camera online one month ago from amazon here [...] and i have taken pictures from alaska to florida and in washington i love how the mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i have every use	1
i 'm sorry but the guy below me does n't know music if he was slapped with a gang starr cd . this mess is ridiculous . i would n't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car . they are the modern day version of young mc....here today gone tomorrow	4
not that great . a far better read is " sun , sin and suburbia : an essential history of modern las vegas " by geoff schumacher .	0
i have thought well of every operating system since dos 3.1. this is without a doubt the worst system i have ever seen . not only is it not graphicaly intuitive , it is incompatible with most all of my 32 bit software . trying to use quicken will crash the computer . it is going to cost a bundle to upgrade all of a person 's softwarein order to use vista . the only thing you will get out of running vista is a lot of headaches	5
brando can sing ! ! guys and dolls is proof . one of the all time great musicals and the biggest box office hit of 1955 , has brando as the main lead and he is ably supported by the voice - sinatra . now only a mad man will say that brando is a better singer than sinatra , but to give brando his due he sang well and carried of the role brilliantly...like wise only a mad man will say sinatra is a better actor than brando . guys and dolls is a very important film in brando 's career . it is the first light hearted movie he made . all his movies before this were heavy dramatic stuff . this is the first movie where brando is having fun and what fun it was . great songs , great acting and great stars...guys and dolls is 4 star entertainment all the way . brando and simmons along with sinatra and blaine are amazing .	2
i am a howard stern fanatic and a softball fanantic . i could n't go wrong with this movie , right ? wrong ! it is pretty bad . i was disappointed with artie 's project . gross jokes terrible acting . there are a couple of funny scenes . wait until it is on sale	2
a ridiculously good album . this is as good an introduction to jawbox as you 're going to find . it 's got most of their really great songs , plus some live songs which are great . another good thing is that desoto records ( the label that was started by the band ) has re-released the cd , so it should n't be as hard to find	4
i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip . my roommate is a snorer , and i figured i needed the sound . i tried it out at home and liked it . it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use . the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel . it was a good buy for my purposes .	3
great product ! i have had a little experience with frontpage , but this product is definitely not frontpage with a new look . this is an easy to use yet professionally powerful tool for web page development . it goes way beyond my abilities . if microsoft continues to develop this product the way it has started....then watch out dreamweaver	5
i purchased this book several months ago . during that time i 've tried several of the recipes - the french lentil soup is very good . the chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing . the chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste . the recipe for mushroom , french lentil and chestnut ragu says to " see glossary " for the chestnuts but there 's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts . it was n't until i read another recipe ( smoky chestnut and sweet potato soup ) that chestnuts were discussed . the mediterranean salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster . far too much red onion ( which my guests mostly picked out ) . although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare . as someone who works full time , a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure , no matter how good it sounds . i had trouble finding some of the ingredients . for example , the author specifies several different types of squash which i have n't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer 's markets . the book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents . if you 're looking for a specific recipe you 'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient . the author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop	0
after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory , this sequel was an absolute let-down . the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie 's ( formerly wonka 's ) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth . while beyond the reaches of earth 's atmosphere , our heroes- --charlie , grandpa joe , and mr. wonka- --must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids ( pronounced " k'nids " ) , aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes . far worse than these beasties , though , are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless . charlie , joe , and wonka , with no help from charlie 's folks or other grandparents , save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory , where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills , returning them to infancy or beyond . charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites , who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters . at the end of the novel , the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president . in short , these three are the most tedious , spiteful , unredeemable characters i 've come across in children 's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book . as it is , they ( unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory ) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last . their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore , rather than a joy , to read .	0
i 've been using this shaver for almost a year , and am disappointed with it . for years , i 've used the older style remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism . i suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better , but i never got used to it . i find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because i feel like i 'll drop it otherwise . the big problem is with the screen . try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen . otherwise , the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood . to clean , it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly , but getting it back on is tricky . if not very careful , it goes on unevenly and gets stuck . with practice , it usually works the first time . the funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall . it looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s	3
this is a nice compact hardback edition of dashiell hammett 's five novels , which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. a veteran of pinkerton detective agency in several cities , hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks , low-lives , and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled , hard-hitting detective stories . this was a time when urban corruption was the rule , and private detectives , journalists , and police officers shared information . two of these novels , & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; are american classics . another , & quot ; the thin man&quot ; , inspired one of hollywood 's best-loved movie franchises . hammett 's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place , laying bare violence , corruption , and pervasive cynicism . but they 're not dreary . the sharp prose crackles , and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it , steadfast in their own codes of conduct , their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism . these five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; appeared first in & quot ; redbook&quot ; , the others in & quot ; black mask&quot ; . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; ( 1930 ) and & quot ; the glass key&quot ; ( 1931 ) are flawless . & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; features private detective sam spade , a irresistible femme fatale , and the ruthless pursuit of an ancient gold statuette . the last pages of the book are some of the most hard-hitting and cynical in all of noir fiction . and they 're brilliant . & quot ; the glass key&quot ; explores political corruption that leads to personal tragedy in an unnamed american city . oddly , the detective is the right-hand man of a crime boss . & quot ; red harvest&quot ; ( 1929 ) features the adventures of hammett 's most popular detective , the continental op , in a town called personville , or poisonville to those who know it better . the always unnamed detective for the continental detective agency finds himself responsible for cleaning up a mining town that is ruled by violence and mob warfare . the novel 's opening paragraph deserves to be read several times . & quot ; the thin man&quot ; ( 1934 ) is an attempt at humor among new york 's blue-blooded , cold-blooded upper crust . hard-boiled humor is interesting in concept . but i find the characters in this novel more pitiful than funny , and hammett 's style was in decline at this point . at least his characteristic cynicism wasn't . & quot ; the dain curse&quot ; ( 1929 ) is another continental op novel . this one is melodramatic , absurd , and not up to hammett 's usual standards . hammett fans should n't miss it , but others may find it pointless . i described the novels in order of descending quality . & quot ; complete novels&quot ; organizes them chronologically . five novels is a lot to pack into one book . but & quot ; complete novels&quot ; does n't resemble a door stop . it 's a handy size actually . the print is not too small , but the pages are quite thin . editor stanley marcus , a literary critic and frequent admirer of hammett 's work , has included a chronology of hammett 's life and several pages of notes on the novels in the back of the book . the chronology is informative and provides all of the apparently significant events in hammett 's life . the notes are mostly definitions of colloquialisms used in the novels , which are useful . the notes also contain an introduction to & quot ; the maltese falcon&quot ; , written by hammett in 1934 , in which he explains the origins of that novel 's characters . it 's quite interesting . for those who prefer to own these novels separately , vintage crime / black lizard hs published some handsome trade paperback editions . but if you want hardback and do n't mind all five novels in one volume , this is quite a nice book	0
i got a pair of these for christmas . initially , i was skeptical about the quality of an inexpensive roof-prism optic , and this is n't my favorite brand name either . but contrary to my expectations , i 've been extremely impressed with them so far . good brightness , contrast , sharpness , field of view , and close focus all exceeded my expectations for a binocular at this price point . feel , fit and finish are all very good . i wear eyeglasses , and these binoculars still deliver a nice wide view through the eyepiece . the twist-down eyecups are quick to extend / retract if you are sharing these with someone who does n't wear glasses . they come with a decent carry case , and relative to porro-prism types , the weight and compactness are both a little bit better . if you are looking for a good binocular for birding or general use , i highly recommend you take a look through these in addition to the other popular models . i think these really hit the sweet spot for price / size / weight / performance , and i 'm very happy with them	1
all things aside , the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor . his name is justin goncalves i think . this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played . in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid . believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had . i was particularly impressed with the part he played .	2
unfortunately , this application includes only a mac os 9 ( not the mac os x as advertised ) version . i cannot review the cds in general , as i cannot run them . why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006 , again in mac os 9 ? frustrating	5
the first version of easy cd creator i used was cd creator 4 basic . it was okay , pretty much what it said it was : basic . i got the upgrade to that from an ebay auction and it worked pretty good . later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new cdrw drives in good old version 4 , i upgraded to cd creator 5 platinum ( the version being sold here . ) this too worked pretty good - for a little while . then the operation was moved over from adaptec to roxio , and from that point onward , things have been more thorny than rosy . roxio will require you to register the product in order to download the ( one ) utterly essential update to keep this thing running . perhaps you do n't mind that , but i feel it 's a somewhat minor invasion of privacy . plus you have to keep track of your password to the website and if you change isp 's you will have to re-register . a hassle to say the least . also , since roxio took the reins , there are no further updates being provided . instead roxio tries to " encourage " ( read " browbeat " ) you into getting the software upgrade for even more money . this upgrade will not work on win98se , which i still use for various reasons . so if i were to upgrade the software again , i would also have to spend the extra money for a new operating system with all the faults and foibles that can introduce with other apps that i need and still use . if you have money to burn along with all those shiny round coasters you are going to be making , i applaud you . i prefer to keep a little cash for retirement . it is difficult if not impossible to get support from any real carbon-based life form , and the website gives little or no support for some of the issues you may face , such as getting " illegal request " errors from direct cd , or inability to format or erase cdrw 's that was once possible in version 4. also , any cdrw 's created in version 4 may not be readable with the new software , or at the least there are some technical issues with this . at any rate , it is not neccessarily all that " easy " unless you are fairly technically inclined and understand ( or are willing to learn ) some of the finer technical points in cd recording technology . i prefer not to be bothered with it , i just want to create some cds . i now find that some functions do not work appropriately at all , especially direct cd , a program that originally provided the ability to do " drag and drop " writing of files to a read / write cd . now i find that direct cd is non-functional , and the only cd 's i can write are cdr 's , and there are problems growing in that area as well . speed of the cdrw or brand of the recording media does not seem to be the issue . the software simply refuses to work as it once did . it should n't be called " easy cd creator " . perhaps " irritating " cd creator would be more appropriate . in summary : this does not deserve stars . perhaps a few " black holes " ? while i once would have given wholehearted supported this product , regrettably i cannot support it with the same enthusiasm now .	5
i got the cd with only disc 2...it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus...im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one.. .	4

previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it . it did not include , however , a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition . the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus . this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively . i am very happy with the program . for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing . the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera . i have not found any particular negatives about the program . in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program . they were very responsive and helpful .	5
the versions of " black sabbath " and " war pigs " actually comprise half of black sabbath 's appearance on the april 26 , 1970 edition of john peel 's ' sunday show . ' " black sabbath " features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song . " war pigs " is actually " walpurgis , " an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics . incidentally , the other two songs from that broadcast , " fairies wear boots " and " behind the wall of sleep , " were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release . all four of these tracks , while fascinating , do n't rightfully belong on this collection , as this disc intends to highlight ozzy osbourne 's career as a solo artist . for that reason , the live version of " paranoid " that appears on this set is equally unnecessary . those songs are frustrating inclusions on an ozzy osbourne greatest hits album , particularly since they come at the apparent exclusion of some of ozzy 's biggest hits and / or notable tracks such as " flying high again , " " shot in the dark , " " i do n't know , " " breaking all the rules , " or " road to nowhere . " to add to the confusion , some of the solo-era material included here is n't exactly what it purports to be . ozzy has been the subject of a number of recent legal disputes over writing and performance royalties . these disputes ostensibly prompted ozzy to reissue his back catalog in 2002 with , in some cases , re-recorded tracks . the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' albums now feature pointlessly re-recorded rhythm parts , presumably as a snub to the original rhythm section of lee kerslacke ( drums ) and bob daisley ( bass ) , who , incidentally , wrote the lyrics to almost every ozzy solo track from ' blizzard of ozz ' through ' no more tears . ' the ' bark at the moon ' album , while not re-recorded , was most certainly remixed . it is the re-recorded versions of the ' blizzard of ozz ' and ' diary of a madman ' tracks and the remixed version of the ' bark at the moon ' track that appear on the current edition of this collection . finally , the version of " no more tears " is actually the video edit , not the album version . in addition , due to one of the disputes mentioned above , ' the ultimate sin ' album was not selected for remastering in 2002 and has subsequently been dropped from ozzy 's catalog . that album 's biggest hit , " shot in the dark , " which appeared on the original 1997 release of this collection , has now been replaced with " miracle man " from ' no rest for the wicked . ' along these lines , the ' just say ozzy ' live ep and the double-disc live album , ' live and loud , ' both of which contain a live version of " shot in the dark , " have also been deleted from ozzy 's catalog . not even ' the essential ozzy osbourne , ' a double-disc collection covering ozzy 's entire solo career , features a single song from ' the ultimate sin . ' the ultimate sin , indeed . my recommendation is to avoid this collection ( and the 2002 remasters ) and instead search for the 1995 remasters or , better yet , search for the original albums on vinyl	4
this was one of the most dissappointing debut albums to come out of the mid nineties g-funk heyday . warren g . did n't even produce one song on this sorry attempt at making hard / soft gangsta rap except for the title track that was already used on his album a year before . the skits are ridiculous , the music is halfass , and the lyrics are amateur . there is absolutely nothing that keeps the listener 's attention for a whole album . this is similar to other west coast rap albums that play it too safe such as w.c. and the madd circle 's debut and coolio 's " it takes a thief " . one star for the hit single " summertime in the l.b.c. " .	4
this software does not come close to the once-upon-a =-time quality of adobe products . it is shot full of bugs overall . not only does it cause your photoshop system to quit working , it affects your entire mac operating system . adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems , not lightroom , can cause problems . their approach of blaming someone else is shameful . the design of the product is marginal ; almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds . it is slower than anything i have ever seen . i could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure . i have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this " half done " system. . if you buy it , you will waste a lot of time like i did . the software is going back to amazon tomorrow morning . amazon , shame on you for selling such a poor product .	5
i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money . i thought this movie was incredibly over acted , boring and hard on the eyes . the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did . they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial . for the superficial people out there i would n't watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you wo n't get it . when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible . i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment	2
great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners	0
since having back problems , especially waking up in the morning , this lumbar extender works wonders for my back . i can easily have a good start for the day from now on ! ! many thanks . b	3
i 've always been a fan of roger moore 's james bond , but what i 've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were , like , actually good . " the spy who loved me " is not one of them . oh , sure , it 's fun - - almost all of the bond flicks are fun - - but it 's basically just a kid 's movie , and that 's not necessarily a good thing . ( 1 ) stromberg is a lame villain . yes , his underwater lair is well-designed , but it 's silly . not as silly as that ice palace in " die another day , " but pretty silly . ( 2 ) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls . she 's not an ugly woman , to be sure , but she was a terrible actress ; she sounds like she 's reading - - poorly - - from a cue card in ever single scene she 's in . ( 3 ) jaws is a stupid character . having metal teeth would n't actually make you capable of biting through metal . the metal you were biting would resist , and you 'd end up just tearing up your gums . i do n't expect realism from 007 movies , but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic . ( that said , jaws is effectively used , and richard kiel was excellent in the role . ) ( 4 ) the disco score is terrible . terrible . ( 5 ) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of " you only live twice , " but on the ocean rather than in space . certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies ! embarrassing . i love bond , but this is not one of the highlights . the dvd is good , with a couple of fine documentaries , but the commentary track grates , because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did . even if that were true , it 'd be annoying	2
[the above is an actual quote from the book] i do n't usually read romances , but got this one at the library . i thought : thriller . hijacked plane , navy seal...all the right stuff . and the beginning was promising . stan fixes everything , and has a human side to him that was compelling . then the plot hit the fan ! as a thriller it stunk . the highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly , as an after thought . the romantic " tension " between the protagonists was forced and irritating . the dialogue is mundane . the message that horniness leads to true romantic ( sam and alyssa ) love is rubbish . the only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl , and i think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed . the historic ( wwii ) componant was interesting . but overall , i kept asking who the audience is for this book . not lovers of thrillers like me- -and i wonder , do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane , or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether teri will ever tell sam that she loves him !	0
i bought this album because i am so into sigur ros at the moment and it seems all the reviews i read say that " ...if you like sigur ros you will like mbv. . " let me say this album is no where near a sigur ros experience . if i could compare them to anyone it would be very early cocteau twins , though i must be clear i do n't think the singer is anywhere close to the artistic sense and vocal talent of elizabeth fraser . it would be more palatable if the production value was higher....it sounds terrible . the sound quality is comparable to some old vhs tapes i have from the mid 80 's that i recorded off the tv ( then soaked in water for a few days ! ) .	4
they do n't make films like this today . it 's a scathing , smart , funny , and thought-provoking look at tv news . but more importantly , it 's a great film about complicated people and their relationships	2
the movie starts out with our hero , izo , being gruesomly crucified . because of his rage towards the ones who crucified him , he travels through time to present day to wreak his vengence on them . then a bunch of stuff happens that has no relevance to the plot really , including : having sex with mother nature , a woman pulling a sword out of her vagina then izo throwing a rock at her face , being killed several times , a very trippy scene where he is sucked underwater and comes up on the other side of some wedding where he kills the groom and bride then is sucked back , killing little children , killing a group of mothers in the hallway , vampires , being attacked by a swat team , and a random guy singing while playing an out of tune guitar . while he does all this he turns into a demon then finally kills the ones that were responsible for his crucifixion . this movie gets 5 stars because it is so random and has made me mentally insane since watching it and other japanese films like it	2
i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama . and that 's exactly what i got . the story was very interesting to me . i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers , especially lucious and ivy . the scary moments just added to the drama . having grown up in the country , i know how scary the woods can be . i loved all the twists to the story . the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance . it was too hammy . i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor , the movie would 've moved along at a better pace . but still a great movie	2
i am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging " palm kernel oil " as an ingredient . do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil , cocoa butter , and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many " organic " things are added to it . for many years now , it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease . the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases .	3
one reviewer remarked that morten veland had & quot ; done it again . &quot ; yup , he shot himself in the foot again , just like he did on tristania 's & quot ; beyond the veil . &quot ; veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements , and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians . his problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect , where it 's appropriate , he just plasters it everywhere , and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible cd . with all of the talent that is present in this band , it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more . the songs where veland does that ( which are all too few ) , like & quot ; on the wane , & quot ; are easily the cd 's best moments . to the band 's credit , the songs are more varied than on botv , with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs ( especially at the beginning of the opening track ) . it 's definitely still melodic goth-metal , but shows some new directions for veland , which i find promising . now , if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the cd...sirenia 's next cd will be a sure winner	4
i like the music , but the sound quality is terrible . i bought this cd because it was released in 2003 , but there is zero improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks	4
i do n't want to spoil this movie for others and i won't . cache is french for hidden and alot was left hidden . why does the son suddenly do what he did ? why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she 's doing ? i did n't care one bit about any of the charactors . this is a slow going movie with no conclusion . if you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry , flip a coin . i watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most us made films . not this one .	2
i bought this cd for one song , & quot ; walk away&quot ; which was one of their best known songs . i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems . there wasn't . the rest of the album is like an anti-climax . i would suggest a greatest hits instead . if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	4
[below is my recent review of the jvc everio gz-mg40 , which has a 20gb hard drive rather than 30gb . becase gz-mg50 seems to be identical to gz-mg40 save the hard drive capacity , i thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy gz-mg50.] - -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - i have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now . and here are my impressions : pros : a ) this is a tiny camcorder and i can easily carry it in my pocket everyday . b ) it records directly on a [30gb] harddrive . this is probably the most amazing feature of this camera . it has the following amazing benefits : ( 1 ) a huge recording space ( 2 ) random access to recorded videos when browsing ( through a thumblist of videos ) ( 3 ) super fast transfer onto your computer through usb 2.0. ( 4 ) no tapes , no cds , no dvds to worry about while recording video . ( 5 ) facilitates easy archiving / organizing . for example , all the recorded files on the camera 's harddrive have " creation date " s as a part of their file information . when the camera is connected to your computer , you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging . ( this is extra , but if you want to index and be able to search your video files , say with google desktop , simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file . ) ( 6 ) the harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media - this is unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux on it and carry with you an operating system on your camera . c ) video quality is good for a consumer level video camera . the sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good : i can hear the lectures i record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera . d ) the charger that comes with this camera is very small . so you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery . cons : a ) no mic jacks . b ) manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus . c ) the editing software that comes with it is limited . d ) the battery life is a mere hour ( but you can buy a 3 hour battery for 70-80 dollars ) . as with all camcorders , the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera . it produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations . the video files recorded by this camera have a " .mod " extension in their name . i replace " .mod " with " .mpg " and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files	1
this model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago . i bought another off of amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it , and i figured i could use a second one to keep in my travel bag . i 'd have to say i 'm pretty pleased with the trimmer . i like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when i want to change the trimming depth . i use it a few times a week , and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge . the little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....it 's catches probably 70% of what i trim . you 'll want to be sure you 're standing over a sink or towel when using it . well worth the $30 i spent for this grooming tool	3
i was skeptical of this product - especially at the price - however i am so pleased with its effectiveness . i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price . i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple . when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years - and i 'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red , angry looking spot . this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne . i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager	3
the hard-copy of britannica has been the standard in reference for centuries , now you can have all of that , with video , audio , tons of photos , and extra support from the web for a fraction of the price of the original . for what you get , it 's an incredible deal and an indispensable part of any reference library	5
great enginering , design and craftmanship ; works great every day ; but i had to throw away a travel size " waterpick " after 18 months , because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else . it does n't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part , on an equipment designed to outlast it three times	3
the first half of this movie starts out promising ; the 2nd half is not so good . it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical , whereas it started out charming and promising . of particular annoyance is the ending , where we find the hackneyed politically-correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple 's separation , and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain , despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he . indeed , the wife 's character is strikingly uneven in this movie : her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie , but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half . quite inconsistent	2

hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd . i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance , even better than tuckwell's . the cadenzas are absolutely awesome . i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well . clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy . i 'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician . highly recommended	4
i 'm really disappointed in this book , because the author seems to imply that you can have anything you want , but that is just not the case . it 's a deceptive title . i can honestly say that this book is worthless and is not going to help you ; you 're better off practising feng shui and hanging little crystals in your house than reading this book ( and i 'm not knocking feng shui , i practise it myself ) . people like the author of this book just want to make a quick buck at your expense . in the end , you 'll just feel worse off , looking for the " next big thing " to promise you some more snake oil . another fact i 'd like to point out is that this author sells this book in cd format for around $60.00 ( i got a flyer in the mail ) . if he is truly living life according to his principles why would he even charge for these so-called " secrets , " does n't that go against his own moral values ? one of the gimmicks of the cds is that you can learn the secret sound of " creation , " as if chanting " ahhhh " is going to make everything alright . thanks to dyer and others like him , i am completely against any sort of " positive thinking " guru . they are only after your money ( while you keep wishing you had more ) . *btw , you might be interested to know that after reading this book , you 're only going to find out that the big catch is that manifesting your destiny , according to the author , only applies to spiritual matters . huh ? yes . the entire book promises you can have anything you want , but it has absolutely nothing to do with material prosperity . the author also wants you to know that if your desire is not in accordance with " god 's " plan , you do n't have a chance either . thought i 'd mention that before you read this book and end up feeling cheated !	0

the book jacket for " the ruins " offers a can't -miss premise : a group of post-grad american tourists at play in mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger . it 's the stuff of great summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach . but 319 pages later , the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket . almost immediately , you 'll notice that smith 's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting . however , despite the endless stream of words , his descriptions are often threadbare . plus , there are no chapter breaks , which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue . next , the characters themselves begin to fall flat . there are only really two couples to keep track of , and yet it 's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them . there is little to keep you interested in what they 're doing or why they might be doing it . smith 's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts . this seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters ' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam . by the end of the book , the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them . and for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as mayan mythology or archeological lore , forget it . aside from language barriers with the locals , there is no reason why this fantastical story could n't have been set in the wilds of the rocky mountains , the saharan desert , or anywhere else . the danger posed has nothing to do with mexico , archeology or mythology at all . ah yes , the danger posed . well , i ca n't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that 's how thin the plot is . the numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right . suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is ( and you 'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do ) , it 's a real eye-roller , as if to say " i read this many pages for this ? " . by the time the story concludes , it 's more irritating than suspenseful . the characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you 'll start rooting against them . eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action , but even aside from being misdirected , it 's too little too late . this book could have been an adventure , a supernatural thriller , a survival tale , or a horror screenplay . it could have even taken the high road as an examination on people 's reactions to situations of extreme stress : some take the lead , even enjoying the challenge , while others whither into a shell of hopelessness . but none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort .	0
maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the russian president and jack ryan are talking to each other through the computer , repeat is spelled " reapeat " . on top of that , the acting was horrible...this movie did n't take itself seriously enough . ben affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in pearl harbor	2

one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters- -sunny randall and jesse stone- -robert b . parker has doubled our fun . quite the reverse . he has cut it in half . the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble ; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes , either . sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout . suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more . the villains- -buddy , erin , missy , gerard , moon- -are little more than vague names and stereotyping . spike is relegated to a scene and a half . oddly , the only interesting character is a very minor one : eddie . but he only stays around for 10 minutes even the plot is tissue-thin . the love-story is lame ; the sex-scenes boring . worst of all , who should appear but ( christ ! ) susan silverman , from the spenser series : one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction . as with " cold service " and some others , parker is just coasting with this one . he is capable of far better .	0
the creators of mia 's reading adventure would be better engaged creating movies and not children 's games . there is just way too much expository and not enough interaction to make this worth your child 's effort . if you 're looking to teach your pre-k / k child reading skills i 'd recommend the blue 's clues games instead . any older children would probably get as frustrated as mine did .	5
this is the worst book of shakespeare criticism i have ever read . bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next . it reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly , handed to a graduate student , and entered into a computer over a weekend . he contradicts himself several times . i donated my copy to the library as soon as i was done reading it , so i cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur ; but several times i recall reading a passage where bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier . to make matters worse , he even says the bard contradicts himself . he points to supposed paradoxes regarding hamlet 's age , stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30. apparently the point is that if shakespeare contradicts himself , so can bloom . bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that hamlet is a slacker . he has not grown up yet . that is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom . some of the book 's observations are interesting , but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from bloom 's notes . interespersed between the passages scribbled down from bloom 's lectures are outbursts where bloom reminds us that shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer , in verse or prose , who ever lived . bloom is a great critic when he still tries , but in this book he was not even trying	0

from the introduction of basic concepts such as likelihood ratios and predictive values to the simple table format with the always beautiful netter illustrations , this is the ortho exam text to have . i just hope the next edition is being planned to keep pace with new research . thank you to joshua cleland for putting this together for us	0
the previous reviews about this product were absolutely correct . the description of this product is a misnomer . the heating pad never heats up , and takes forever to just warm up . on a scale of 1 to 5 , i would rate it a zero ! do n't waste your money on this . i will be returning mine	3
do n't buy the directors cut . badder santa is absolutely hysterical . for some strange reason the director decided to make a " director 's cut " that is a neutered version of " badder santa " . i bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from billy bob in the first scene was missing . the celebration in the bar after the first mall " heist " , where billy bob proclaims he 's giving up drinking , was missing . the next scene where billy bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing . that was enough for me . i immediately shut it off and best buy agreed to let me swap it for " badder santa " due to the false impression of a " longer and fuller " cut than it 's predecessor , as is the industry standard . i was duped . please buy " badder santa " instead . this is a watered down / walmart version of a classic , not an extended cut	2

as a social worker in private psychotherapy practice , i find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times i question whether i should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy . mary pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion , empathy , listening skills , reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless . furthermore , even if i was n't a therapist i think i would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read . i highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades . this book is bound to become a classic	0
this item is cute . my only complaint is that it really can only hold the camera . there is no space for an extra card or battery . it does however have a convenient belt clip on the back that you could also attach a shoulder strap to .	1
i did n't have especailly high hopes for this book . i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years , and this one brings it to a new low . basically , it 's waaaaaay too long . at 850 pages , it 's a monster read , and a slow one . that 's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it 's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page . but not here . why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language ? for several paragraphs ? more than once ? why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services ? i think i 'd be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book , though i ca n't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it 's been out of use here for decades ! maybe it was easy to cut and paste , and got the word count up . and then there 's the space combat - a strength of the series , especially the first three or four . but there 's the rub - there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up . by the 11th book in the series i ca n't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences . but the big problem - spoiler alert ! - is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with . honor loves hamish . emily loves hamish . hamish loves honor and emily . what to do ? it turns out that there 's an easy solution . after about 400 pages of agonising ( not to mention most of the previous book ) it seems that honor can marry them both . a bit outre ? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom . ( although we 've never had a whiff of this before . ) but what really gets me is that the reason it did n't happen about halfway through the last book is that ( get this ) , gosh , no-one thought of it . it seems that no-one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v , the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i . all-in-all , i can only say , please mr weber . it is time to bring the series to an end . please do it soon	0

the title says it all : one month the warranty expired , the zoom feature on the camera broke , making a horrible grinding noise if you attempted to turn it on . the camera is all but useless . the fuji shop said they need to replace the lens assembly , at a cost of at least us$120 ; for that price , i 'm buying a new camera , but not another f10.	1
i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas , and he is absolutely in love with them . the distance it can handle is slightly above average , but the clarity is really where this thing shines . its very easy to use , and has held up reasonably well . i would recomend it to the casual user	1
i have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem . they are n't dragon feet , but they do have to be softened pretty often . i have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when i saw the artemis heel smoother advertised , i decided i had to try it . it 's a waste of money . the appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml . in fact , i have a dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better . the artemis appliance does not scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on . it comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma . i would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing . save your money .	3
this is a fantastic version of taming of the shrew . for anyone who is interested in really studying the text ( and hearing it spoken correctly ) , this is the version for you ! the actors speak clearly and loudly and the main point is that they completely understand what they are saying - ( yipee ! ) they also have an uncanny way of " speaking the speech " which gets it across to the audience as clear as day . you dont need to understand ' shakespearean verse ' to see this performance . the actors breeze through this with ease and simplicity and look like they are having a blast - which i belive they are !	2
francisco was right , this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust . the review on the back of the dvd says " jaw dropping , " but the full quote probably reads " jaw dropping ( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby ) " . there is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage , in the zombie attack scenes , but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie . the rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters , ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant " evil side of human nature " message that would be better left to jean renoir ( or even adam sandler considering the results here ) . i do n't watch zombie movies for the characters , especially characters so vapid and unengaging . it seemed like the script writer read a novice 's how to pamphlet and said " yeah , it needs some conflict " . if these characters were n't so constipated and bloated i 'd give them a chance . one amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of " social commentary , " but that 's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully . it wasn't . you 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass . the critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing , and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent , which is ( you guessed it ) the lovely undead . the rest is monotonous dreck . i do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags . all that aside , the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies . a horror movie that sucks for 3 / 4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself , but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads . sorry , but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron .	2
have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid . instructions worthless - - only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error . after getting best possible settings , main problem is still picture quality : using high quality jpg files as input , photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies - - individual dots very noticeable even at some distance . not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames . just arrived from amazon and intended as a v-day gift ( tomorrow ) for my wife , big disappointment , guess i better make a dash to the florist .	1
this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10. when one battery runs out , the spare goes in . the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay . they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it. .	1
we read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper . we ( my husband , three kids 14 , 10 , and 5 ) tried it on a warm , spring evening in the car . one or two songs , like the banana splits , speed racer , and scooby-doo were fun . most however , were harsh , and too fast for the parents and youngest guy . i would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers	4
we went to a book siging to get this book . truthfully , i was n't sure if the book was going to live up to the hype . t.o. graciously signed books and all proceeds went to charity . i was surprised this book was so well written . my four year old wants me to read it over and over again . he does n't like for me to read to him but he loves this book ! it is the perfect book for children . its not too short but not too long . i have read this book at least 10 times in the past 3 days . i would recommend this book to anyone with small children . it is great book for little boys because of the football theme . however , the lesson is something everyone can appreciate . great book	0
the book is fine , except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer . she 's such a boring character . she 's young , but not motivated to work . in fact , she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent . the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men , and get support . the point is that she does n't enjoy the job , thus , a detailed description of her dog training job ( which she does n't seem to enjoy ) was just a boring digression	0
hard to figure why sean stewart is n't one of the most beloved writers in america , given the virtuoso performance he 's demonstrated here and the remarkably sympathetic character he 's created in will kennedy . a combination horror / fantasy work which is as reminiscent of a confederacy of dunces as it is ghosts , by hynd , this novel is filled with so much warmth and life that it 's hard to remember that this actually is a story about a man who understands that the past , too , can be a ghost , and perhaps the worst kind . perfect circle is everything every other supposed 5-star horror novel featured on amazon is supposed to be : well-written , compelling , with rich , empathetic characters and a driving force and tension all its own . it 's a wonderful introduction to mr. stewart 's work	0
i found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics , with no insights . since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors , and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface , i was n't expecting historical depth . but i was expecting at least one fresh idea . i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg ( about technology in the economy of the 19th century ) . i was disappointed . i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower - - college freshmen born in the 1980s . i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy	0
i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item . i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass-through on my sony minidv handycam . i bought this way-too-expensive cable , mostly because it was the only option available . it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low-end disk drive or graphics card , considering the technology involved in those devices . but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s-video connection is useless for input . this information is nowhere on the package , nor is it on their website . there is a notice saying " please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase " . you ca n't read that warning when buying online , and if buying at a store , there 's no way to know what 's compatible because they do n't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package . i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website , then come back to the store and buy it , instead of just buying it and seeing if it works . there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one , however they fail to mention that the sony cable wo n't work , despite the premium price they charge . if the problem is that they could n't make it work with both a composite and s-video cable , then they should have just made it work for s-video , since a composite cable comes with the camera . shame on you , sony , for adding a little aggravation to my day , and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard . it 's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder ( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i do n't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick ) . rant over .	1
i just watched " mommie dearest " for the first time tonight . as most critics and fans of " mommie dearest " acknowledge , the film portrays such a pitiful story of abuse , with such an over-dramatic ( but entirely true-to-life ) performance by faye dunaway , it was both hilarious and depressing . i 'm 30 and did n't know much about joan crawford outside of the endless chatter about the film being " classic camp . " seems to me crawford was probably bi-polar or had some other unexplained mental disorder . i think she was quite aware that some of the insanity she lived with was caused by movie industry she was dedicated to . she knew the industry poisoned any good thing she endeavored to do , whether it was having a successful marriage , a happy family , or even giving to charity . her life was a running commercial directed by hollywood , not unlike the tabloid-driven , image-obsessed hollywood we have today . despite the often-times hilarious image of her and her sibling 's victimization on film , christina 's abuse and disappointment with her mother was real and painful at some point in her life . christina crawford was completely justified turning her mother 's image on its head with her book and movie . yes , the movie is outrageous but it is also empowering . after all , what can the powerless do about their pitiful past except laugh . mocking the unexplained , unjustified pain you experienced in the past , renders it powerless to harm your future . this is the legacy of " mommie dearest " whatever joan crawford really was	2
outstanding ! i new a remastered version of ran was a must have , but i did not expect to enjoy madadayo as much as i did . while i agree the packaging does not protect the disks well , i got lucky and had no damage . i wonder how they will handle this issue if they truly only made 5 , 000	2
i looked for an introduction to the basics of office automation and bought this book . every example code i tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial . samples from the msdn was just as good as this book . if you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there , this book is ok . but for any real programming it is not very useful .	0
i bought this for my boyfriend . i needed something affordable , and this was it . the bubble machine is quiet , and the warmth of the water lasts for a pretty long time . the only complaint i have are the warnings it has . it just gets me uneasy and that something drastic might happen if i make a mistake . well other than that , this product is good . i 've had it for i think a couple of months now , and nothing awful has happened and it 's still working fine . :	3
jmaes joyce takes us on stephen daedalus ' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of dublin , struggling with sin , salvation , intellect , ambivalence about his homeland , and his father 's decline . it is not a linear path , but then whose is ? the story is not so much about the artist as a young man , but about a young man 's journey to artistic sensibility , its pretensions and exhilirations . jaklak sez check it out	0
the subject provided a good historical perspective on japan 's renaissance period , post civil wars and pre-westernization . in many respects musashi , a ronin represents japan 's search for an identity , a country ruled by military might in the form of the shogun , yet keeping an emperor who they revered as a god , a god without power . this sword saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel ; he was also an artist , a lithographer and an author . yet , he was masterless , masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer 's devotion to his master . he was his own master , in a time when japan had no voice , serving all , without righteous . it would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the samurai , that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of miyamoto musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession , master of the sword	0
my youngest brother , who has a pretty strange sense of humor , bought me this cd for my birthday ; i wonder how he knew i did n't own it already ? i do n't even know where to begin with this one . what can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop ? and the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable . does she expect anyone to take her seriously ? after her first album , i thought carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning , particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches . instead of getting better , though , she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices . rappers like jay-z , snoop dogg , missy elliott and usher are brought in to add spice , but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing . she may have a lot of #1 hits , but who can tell any of them apart ? rainbow is only carey 's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere . d - tom rya	4
